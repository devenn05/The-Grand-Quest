Chapter 6: Goodbyes

### **Goodbye, Before the Storm**

The week passed in a blur, a strange mix of excitement and an unspoken sadness that settled over the estate like morning mist. There was something different in the air, something heavy. Even I could feel it, though I was too young to understand why.

Celestia was everywhere, darting from room to room like a gust of wind, making last-minute requests, checking her things over and over. She acted like she had everything under control, but I could feel the nervous energy buzzing beneath her skin. It wasn’t fear—Celestia never got scared. It was something else. Something even I didn’t have words for yet.

The estate itself felt... off. Servants moved with urgency, Alfred, our butler, stood a little too still, his usual sharp posture softened by something I couldn’t quite name. He watched Celestia closely, his gloved hands tightening behind his back.

“Do take care, young mistress,” he said at one point, his voice softer than I’d ever heard it.

Celestia only grinned. “Of course, Alfred. Don’t get all sentimental on me now.”

Even I could tell it was an act.

Lillian—Mother—had made a decision without telling Celestia. She wasn’t going alone. A woman named Lily had been assigned to travel with her. To everyone else, she was just a maid, but I had heard Mother whisper to Father late at night. She was more than that. She was strong, a Primordium user. A protector.

Even Celestia, for all her excitement, noticed the way Mother’s gaze lingered on Lily. She didn’t ask, though. Maybe she already knew.

And then, finally, the moment arrived.

The grand doors of the estate stood open, the morning air crisp and cool. The carriage waited outside, sleek and black with silver engravings, horses that looked like they came from a storybook standing harnessed at the front. Their breath misted in the air, their silver-tipped manes catching the sunlight. It looked important. It looked like it belonged to someone who was leaving for something great.

Not long after, another carriage rolled up, and two figures stepped out.

Stephanie practically exploded from it. “Celestiaaa!” she squealed, running forward with a grin so wide it looked like her face might split. “You’re finally coming!”

Serina followed behind at a more measured pace. She didn’t say much, but I caught the flicker of something in her eyes.

Cedric arrived soon after, exchanging a look with Father. A silent conversation passed between them. One only men like them could understand.

As the last of the luggage was loaded, something in the air shifted. The excitement, the flurry of movement—it all slowed.

Celestia turned to Father.

He stood there, looking at her, and I saw something I’d never seen before. His golden eyes, always so unreadable, were filled with something raw. Something heavy. Then, before I could even process it, he pulled her into his arms.

Celestia froze, caught off guard. Father wasn’t like this. He was warm in his own way, but he didn’t do things like this.

His embrace was firm, like he was memorizing the shape of her. Like he was trying to hold onto something already slipping away. “Stay safe, Cel,” he murmured, his voice steadier than it should’ve been. “No matter where you are, if you need me—just send word. I’ll be there.”

Celestia swallowed hard. “I’ll be fine, Daddy.”

He pulled back just enough to look at her, his hands still gripping her shoulders. “You don’t know that,” he said, a breath of a chuckle escaping him, but there was no humor in it. “That’s what makes this so damn hard.”

Then Mother stepped forward. She was softer than Father, but her strength was just as undeniable. She tucked a stray lock of Celestia’s hair behind her ear, her fingers lingering for just a moment longer than necessary. “Take care of yourself, my love,” she said gently. “Be strong, but don’t forget to be kind. Power means nothing if you lose sight of who you are.”

Celestia nodded, blinking rapidly.

And then she turned to me.

I didn’t understand why everyone was acting like this. Why Father looked like he was trying to hold the whole world together with just his hands. Why Mother’s voice trembled even though she tried to hide it. Why Celestia looked like she wanted to cry but refused to let herself.

To me, it was simple. My big sister was going on a trip. She’d be back soon.

I giggled as she crouched down and pressed a soft kiss to my forehead, her fingers brushing through my hair. “I’ll be back before you know it, baby Summer,” she whispered.

She lied.

She didn’t mean to. She truly believed it.

None of us knew the truth.

This was the last time Celestia and I would ever see each other.

Destiny had other plans.

She stood, her gaze sweeping over us all one last time. Then, without another word, she turned and climbed into the carriage.

The wheels began to move. The horses’ hooves clattered against the stone path. Slowly, the carriage rolled forward, carrying her away from us, from home, from everything familiar.

Celestia turned back, her eyes locking onto mine as I waved, grinning, oblivious.

I didn’t know.

I didn’t know that sometimes, destiny is cruel.

The carriage disappeared into the horizon.

And just like that… she was gone.
