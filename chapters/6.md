Suddenly, I was back in that cavern, only a few seconds behind from when I had entered some sort of void—whatever it was. Batting my eyes, feeling like I was stuck in some twisted death-row déjà vu, I turned my attention to the anomaly heading straight toward me.

I couldn’t even take a step back. My leg buckled, and I collapsed, the toll of walking, of consuming essence without any limitations, finally catching up to me. Draven’s dead expression was heading toward me, unrelenting.

I gave in. This was it. If only I’d been born a prodigy like Cel... But even then, this bastard was just too much.

I didn’t even try to get up. Still on my knees, I gave in. My hands pressed against the cold ground, my eyes lifted to the cavern above, watching the darkness swirl as my life played out before me. What a failure I had been. The regrets, the disappointment Father must feel toward me—it all flashed before my eyes, one after another. This was it. The deathbed thought everyone has when they're about to die.

Angrily, I punched the ground, my fingers snapping without meaning to. The sharp sound cut through the silence, unexpected. And then—

*Everything froze.*

Draven—mid-step, one foot lifted, the other rooted—paused like a living statue. The torch beside him hung in the air, its flame suspended as if caught in amber. The cave held its breath. His Essence—the pulsing rhythm I’d felt like a heartbeat—solidified around him, turning into a visible haze of suspended particles.

It was as if the universe had slammed on the brakes and left me behind, lungs heaving, mind racing.

And then,

It snapped back, the world came alive again. The torches flickered. Draven’s arm jerked forward, his expression still in place.

I was completely dazed, my heart racing, trying to make sense of what the hell just happened. 

Was it because I snapped? Or was it something else… like that feeling of the void I had earlier?

Did—did I just freeze time? Is that even possible?

I feel it. I know something’s changed. But I can’t put it into words.

I don’t know why or how. But it happened.

And whatever it is? It feels big. Too big to ignore.

I shake myself out of it. No time to think. Because Draven—clueless as ever—doesn’t even realize what just happened.

But this time, as he closes in on me, I can feel it. The next strike—it's not going to be another taunt. He’s not playing anymore. Essence coils around his left hand like a snake about to bite.

With a gulp, I think—

It’s not something I can control… right? Not just a snap of my fingers.

It can’t be that simple.

I snap my fingers.

Again—

*Everything freezes.*

For about two seconds, the world pauses. Like it’s holding its breath. 

For whole two seconds!

And then—just like that—it resumes. Smooth. Effortless. As if nothing happened.

I thought to myself, Most likely… a second Primordium. And not just any kind.

Reality Influence.

That golden light—what the living hell was that? The flash, the moment before it all started… it wasn’t just some random hallucination. It meant something, wasn’t it? 

The thought alone makes my skin crawl. I can’t even process it.

In the middle of my spiraling thoughts, Draven closes the distance. His hand moves—too fast—and essence swirls violently. A slash of wind tears toward me before I can even react.

I was not ready.

My brain still whirling—

But then, instinct kicks in.

I snap!

Time freezes again.

Draven’s attack—an Essence slash, sharp and glowing—halts midair, suspended just inches from my face. It hangs there, frozen in time, like the world skipped a beat.

I don’t waste a second. My body moves before my brain can catch up. I dive to the side, rolling hard across the cave floor—barely dodging the slash.

Time snaps back.

The world resumes like nothing happened. But Draven? He steps forward, sure he’s just taken my head off. Another easy kill. Another win.

But I’m not where he thought I’d be.

The look on his face—

His eyes narrow. He blinks. A step back. Brow furrows in disbelief as he stares at the space where I should have been. And for the first time, I see it on his face—doubt.

He can’t wrap his head around it.

No way in hell someone like me dodges that. Not with the gap between us. Not with his speed. Not with how broken I am.

But here I am.

Alive. Breathing.

He looks at me like I’ve broken the rules or something. 

His confidence? Cracked. And just for a moment, he’s left with nothing but questions.

And in that moment, I start to believe I might survive this.

But then—

My body gives out.

My legs buckle. I drop. Hard. Like someone pulled the plug. The crash is instant.

That’s when I know—this is definitely my doing.

My Essence pool just took a dump. I should be unconscious. The wounds alone were draining me fast, but now? That new power... whatever the hell it is, it ate through my reserves like they were nothing.

Any hope I had—flickering, fragile—is gone again.

In all of this, I barely register Draven. But suddenly—he changes. The ever-composed vampire oozing superiority—his expression shifts. Anger flickers. His lips curl into a sneer. Then frustration. His sharp eyes narrow, colder now, colder than before.

He still can’t understand what happened.

Then he asks, voice low and dangerous, “What the fuck did you just do?”

And now comes the real problem—

What the hell am I supposed to do now?

Just when I give up, the universe throws me a bone—something powerful. Something I think I can use against him. And now, when the moment’s finally here… it takes away my damn limbs.

But then a new thought strikes me.

Even if, somehow, I could use this power—would it even matter? How the hell do I kill this bastard if I can’t even scratch him? With his Essence pool, he could wrap himself in a shield strong enough to tank an avalanche. And hardening my own arm with Essence? I've been trying that for years. Never worked.

There’s nothing I can do… is there?

With a defeated slump, I whisper, “I saw it coming.”

Draven tilts his head, confused.

“Your wind slash,” I say. “I saw it. I saw it coming.”

It’s not a lie. I did see it. Just… not in a way he’ll ever understand.

He clicks his tongue, the sound bouncing off the cave walls. Then he starts walking—slow, heavy steps. Each one lands like a hammer on my chest.

I remember the stories. Vampires—invincible monsters. But not flawless.

A wooden stake through the heart? That could stop them. Wounds from wood are dangerous—maybe even fatal.

Only problem? I’m not holding a damn tree branch.

If only I were a Manifestation user…Fuck, what is wrong with me? What the hell am I even thinking?

My only shot is to immobilize him. Break his focus. Drive him off the edge until he can’t hold his own mind together long enough to stop me from running.

Only way this flips is if I can harden my arm... after using that freakish time-stop thing.

Yeah. As if.

My Essence is already in the dirt. Pulling it off again? No chance. And hardening on top of that? I’d need a miracle. If I could do that, I’d be in Obsedia right now, surrounded by scholars.

But…

I gulp hard.

If I can pull this off... I just might kill this fucker.

Then, it hits me—Zane’s words, back when I was struggling just to coat my body in Essence.

*"You’re chasing greatness like it owes you something. It doesn’t. You think power obeys the strong? It bows only to the relentless—those who bleed courage in fear’s face and keep walking when hope lies dead.”*

I open my eyes. Draw in a breath.

I clench my fists. This is it. My line in the sand. My last goddamn shot.

Draven senses something. His stare sharpens. But he has no idea what’s coming. No clue what just happened inside those six frozen seconds.

He sneers. “Well. It was nice meeting you.” as he raises another wind blade.

To the gods above—whatever’s watching—I leave the rest to you.

I snap my fingers.

Adrenaline floods me. Raw, electric. I pour everything I have left into my right arm. Essence floods through it like lightning through wire.

Never—not once in the last year and a half—have I pulled this off.

But here it is.

Hardening.

My arm glows, white-hot with Essence, flickering like a dying star. Pure. Sharp. Real.

Draven is right in front of me.

Without wasting even a millisecond I move.

A blur of motion. I aim straight for his neck—no hesitation.

The sound is brutal. Like tearing wet steel.

A crack. A hiss.

A snap like thunder cracking through bone.

His head goes flying.

But I barely register it.

Blackness crashes in.

Before those two seconds even fade, my body gives out—my mind slips, blinking into nothingness.

And then I hear it.

A voice.

A third presence, standing behind Draven’s falling body.

“I see. I’m not the one to take…”

That’s all I catch before everything fades to black.

---

*When is this damn tunnel going to end? Am I just supposed to walk like this for eternity?*

*I can’t keep going. Not like this. I’ve already lost a freakin’ arm and a leg. What’s even the point of surviving if there’s barely anything left of me to save?*

*And what the hell is up with this cave? I’ve lived in Riverton my whole life—never heard of anything this massive. Not in Lunaris, not even close. Is this place even in Lunaris anymore? Or gods forbid… did I somehow cross out  of Avalon?*

*Doesn’t matter. I’m not making it out. Not from this cave, and sure as hell not from that vampire.*

---

Birds chirping. That’s the first thing I hear.

Not my own heartbeat. Not the ringing in my ears. Just… birds. Singing. Light, scattered sounds cutting through the silence like they don’t belong.

Where the hell am I?

The ground beneath me feels soft—damp soil, the scent of moss and bark thick in the air. My head’s pounding, and there’s a weird pressure in my chest, like I’ve just been pulled out of a dream that didn’t end properly.

Am I in a forest?

I hear myself breathing—shaky, uneven. Leaves rustle. The sunlight filters through dense canopies overhead, painting everything in patches of gold and green. My back is resting against a rock, rough and cool, and as I push myself upright with a grunt, I realize—

I’m holding something.

I look down.

A head. A severed vampire’s head.

Draven.

I jerk in horror, nearly lose balance, and fling it across the grass like it’s on fire. It tumbles through the underbrush and lands with a sickening thud. The once-proud bastard—reduced to nothing more than a lifeless skull. His eyes stare blankly, still wide open in disbelief, veins dark and swollen. His mouth is frozen mid-scream, jaw slack, fangs smeared with blood. His tongue dangles out the side, limp, bloated, twisted like some grotesque mockery of what he used to be.

A monster, now nothing more than meat.

I stare at my shaking hands, bile crawling up my throat.

What the fuck is happening…?

I look around, really look this time. I don’t recognize a thing. Trees tower in every direction—ancient, gnarled, looming like sentinels. No path. No signs. Just wilderness.

I don’t know where I am.

But that’s not the craziest part.

No.

The craziest part is—

My arm. My leg.

The ones Draven cut off.

They’re here.

Whole. Unbroken. Moving. Perfectly fine.
