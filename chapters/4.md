The pain so overwhelming that I couldn't even process the horrifying reality—my arm was completely torn off. Blood gushed from the wound, pooling beneath me in a sickening crimson flood. It was a torrent I couldn’t escape, soaking into the cold, unforgiving stone beneath me. I couldn't feel anything but the searing agony, every nerve in my body screaming in protest, and yet there was nothing I could do but lie there, suffering. I was helpless. Completely. Utterly helpless.

Minutes passed. Maybe hours. Time felt irrelevant, like it had warped into some strange, unrecognizable thing. I couldn’t tell how long I’d been here, how long I’d been drifting in and out of consciousness, caught in the agony of it all.

But I knew if I lost any more blood, that was it—I was done. So, summoning what little strength I had left, I forced my Essence to move. Shaky, desperate, I willed it toward the gaping wound, trying to seal the veins, stop the bleeding. The pain was unreal—sharp, deep, and constant, like fire under my skin. It clawed at my sanity, threatened to drown me, but I couldn’t give in. I wouldn’t. I clenched my teeth until my jaw ached, until I swore I’d crack a fucking molar. Slowly—painfully slowly—my breathing began to steady.

After what felt like an eternity, I regained a sliver of composure—just enough to push through the next hurdle. My body screamed in protest, each movement a fresh wave of torment. But I couldn’t stop. I had to move. Had to do something—anything to get out of this hell.

My eyes darted around the cave, desperate for some kind of answer, some way out. I couldn’t afford to stay here. I had to find something, some way to keep going. Although the cave was cloaked in near-total darkness, the moss clinging to the walls gave off a faint, bluish glow—just enough to make out the rough shapes around me. In the distance, around the torch, I spotted it—a narrow path winding deeper into the darkness, this might be the same route Draven had taken when he left. My heart pounded in my chest. It was a lifeline, or at least it could be.

Confused about whether I should even go that way, I started walking toward it. My mind was spinning. I’d just seen a fucking vampire. And that fucker was one of Dunford’s own guards. The same bastard I saw back at the castle, arguing with one of ours. The same damn fucker.

No one had a clue he was right under our noses—the one responsible for massacring an entire fucking village and many more citizens of Lunaris.

And then more thoughts started clicking into place. A vampire... with Reality Influence Primordium. He literally tore open a warp out of thin air and dragged me through it. Then he hit me with something—some strange-ass attack that sliced into my hand like it was nothing.

I still don’t even know what the hell he did.

The first vampire I ever laid eyes on who’s Reality Influencer who uses a warp gate.… and he might be an dual Primordium wielder.

What kind of cursed luck was I born with?

 But then, a new thought struck me, sharp and cold.

Every victim I’ve seen or heard about who was hunted by this damn vampire had one thing in common—he only left their head. That was it. Just the fucking head. And here I was... missing an arm. What the hell did that mean? Was he planning to take me apart piece by piece? Legs next, then the other arm, and eventually just leave me with my damn torso lying around?

But I don’t have the luxury to think about it for too long. I don’t have a choice. There’s only one thing I can do now. I have to keep moving forward. No other option.

So, despite the pain, despite the exhaustion clawing at my mind, I force my body to take the first step. My legs tremble beneath me, my movements shaky and uneven. One step, then another, each footfall slamming pain through my spine. But I kept going. I had to. I couldn’t let this be the end.

For half an hour, I walked. The silence of the cave presses down on me, suffocating. Every breath feels like it might be my last, my chest tightening with each shallow inhale. The only sound is the ragged rasp of my breath, the echo of my staggered footsteps bouncing off the cold stone. And yet, despite the burning agony that fills my body, I can’t stop. Not now.

Then suddenly...

Laughter.

A cruel, mocking laugh.

Draven stood ahead, leaning against the cave wall, his crimson eyes gleaming with amusement.

“I knew you’d come,” he sneered. “I was waiting for you.” 

I wasn’t surprised by his sudden appearance anymore.

“You really think you’ll stay hidden forever?” I spat, stepping forward. “They’ll get to you—my father, Cedric—they’re already heading to the witness. That laugh you just had? It won’t last once they start putting the pieces together.”

He smirked. Calm. Too calm.

“Which witness?” he asked, almost amused.

A ripple of space shimmered beside him—dark, twisted—and from it dropped a headless corpse.

Still twitching.

“This one?” he said, voice light. “Was he the one? Poor thing. Couldn’t even make it past the gates with those weak ass guards And even if he had…” He leaned in slightly, eyes flat and dead, “Do you really think your precious family could do anything to me?”

I clenched my fists. He’d killed the only witness—the one person who could’ve led them to the truth. Maybe even to me. And now here he is, a lifeless corpse.

“Let’s be honest,” he went on, voice low and cutting. “Them knowing who I am doesn’t change a damn thing. Sure, I might’ve had to pull back. Maybe pick a different village or a city. Hell, even a different country if I felt like it.”

“Those guards? You? I didn’t plan on any of this—until that damn witness saw my face. I couldn’t just leave loose ends.” His eyes locked on mine. “You were just in the wrong place at the wrong time.”

He smiled—cruel yet somehow sad. “Don’t worry. I’ll send your head back to your family Neatly and leave, I don’t really plan to live more on this cursed Continent. ”

“So that’s it?” I asked. My throat dry. “You’re just gonna leave?”

He chuckled.

“Oh, not yet. I want to see how you’ll look with one leg gone. Which one do you think—left or right?” as he started walking towards me.

A wave of panic crashed through me. I had to move. Now.

My body trembled, but I forced the words out between shallow breaths. “N-no… fuck not again. Please.” I stumbled back a step. “Why not just finish…..?”

Before I could even finish, a streak of essence sliced through the air.

This time, I saw it clearly—he conjured a blade of wind straight from his palm.

He was definitely a dual Primordium user—second primordium being Manifestation, no doubt about it.

I barely registered the pain, but before I knew it, my left leg was severed from my body.

The world tilted. My vision swam. The shock was instant—white-hot, blinding—but the pain… the pain was something else entirely.

A guttural scream tore from my throat, raw and ragged. My body convulsed. I clawed at the ground, desperate for something—anything—to anchor me.

Draven caught the severed limb as it slipped through a ripple of warped space. Calmly, almost lazily, he brought it close, inspected it… then took a sip like it was some sort of Champagne.

Instantly he spat it out.

“Ugh. Tastes like shit.” He wrinkled his nose, flicking the leg back at me. Thud. “Maybe I should’ve taken the other arm.”

I writhed, shrieking, pain flooding every corner of my body. My nerves were on fire. My vision tunneled. My breathing turned shallow, frantic—more panic than air. I couldn’t stop shaking. Couldn’t think.

It was too much.

Too much.

The edges of my world began to darken.

And then—

Everything went black.

Draven sighed, loud and bored. “Tch. Passed out already?” He rolled his eyes and turned away. I passed away. 

---

The garden was glowing.

Sunlight spilled like honey through the branches, lighting up the silverleaf trees and the flowerbeds that stretched out in every direction. I could hear the chimes hanging from the old gazebo, swaying in the breeze. Everything smelled like lilac and mom’s hair when she hugged me.

“Faster, Sun!”

Celestia’s voice rang through the garden. I saw her up ahead, running barefoot, her white dress floating like she had wings. She looked back and laughed, her smile bigger than the sun.

“You cheated!” I shouted, chasing after her, legs pumping, hair in my eyes. “You said no essence!”

“I didn’t use essence!” she called out, but I saw that glimmer in her step when she turned. She was always faster.

She tapped my forehead. “Tag! You’re it!” Then she ran again, screaming through her giggles.

We collapsed beneath the trellis, the one covered in ivy and old purple flowers. I couldn’t stop laughing. My heart felt like it was flying.

But when I tried to stand again, my foot caught the edge of a root.

I slipped—hard.

The pain came fast and sharp in my leg. I sat up with a cry, tears stinging my eyes.

“Sun!” Cel dropped to her knees, wrapping her arms around me. “It’s okay, it’s okay. Look at me.”

I sniffed. “It hurts...”

She brushed the hair from my eyes and kissed my forehead. “I’ve got you, alright? I’ll always be here. I’ll protect you, no matter what. I’ll never leave you.”

And in that moment, I believed her.

Then the light dimmed. The garden faded. Her voice slipped away.

And I woke up.

My eyes fluttered open, a blur of confusion clouding my vision. Tears welled up. The pain had dulled into a numb, hollow sensation. My body felt like it was made of shattered glass—every movement sent waves of agony through me, but there was nothing left to break. My face was flushed, streaked with tears that fell without me even realizing it.

Why was I crying?

Was it the pain?

Or was it that dream?

Was I crying because of the dream... or because I knew I’d never feel that again?

Or maybe it was both.

A cruel reminder of everything I’d lost.

I swallowed hard, the lump in my throat burning like acid. My body was hanging on by a thread, but I pushed what was left of my essence through the wreckage of my limbs, desperate to summon even the smallest bit of strength. It felt like dragging myself through quicksand, but I didn’t have a choice. I couldn’t stop now. I wouldn’t.

So I started moving. Hobbling forward on one leg, clinging to walls, shelves—anything I could reach for.

I knew what was ahead. I knew it was just him. That monster, that twisted, sadistic creature who had taken everything from me. I knew there was no escape. No sudden miracle. No happy ending waiting to pull me from this hell.

Man, I really wished I could spend even one more day with my family.

It was a stupid thought—I knew that. A useless, empty wish. But it was the only thing keeping me going. The only thing anchoring me to what was left of reality. The thought of seeing them again, just once… sitting at the table, laughing, eating—normal. I clung to that memory like a lifeline.

So I walked.

I didn’t really know how much time had passed. Minutes? Hours? The darkness in the cave stretched on like a nightmare without end—almost impossible to navigate, suffocating in its silence, but the moss helped. Its faint glow clung to the stone, guiding me through the black.

My body screamed with every step. My throat felt like sandpaper, cracked and raw from thirst. Every muscle was pulled tight, trembling, stretched so thin it felt like they could snap with the wrong move.

But I couldn’t stop. I wouldn’t.

There was nothing else left.

My leg was barely holding, my breath shallow, my Essence flickering like a dying flame. I was on the edge. One stumble away from the end.

Up ahead, I caught a glimpse of red—faint at first, then growing bolder, like a gradient bleeding through the dark. Torchlight. But unlike the flickering flames I’d seen before, this one was steady, bright—almost unnaturally so.

Hope sparked in my chest.

I stumbled toward it, dragging myself faster, until the narrow tunnel gave way to something wider.

A cavern.

Not just another cave, but a space—vast and still. A chamber, shaped with intention. It didn’t feel natural. It felt carved. Ancient. Ritualistic.

Torches lined the walls, flames flickering wildly, casting long, shifting shadows that made the stone ripple like it was breathing. The air was heavy—smoke, damp earth… and beneath it all, the faint, metallic scent of blood.

And there he was—.

Draven.

Sitting there on a jagged rock, silently staring at the ceiling.

I was too exhausted to react. My body refused to move, as if it had forgotten how to obey. Every inch of me was screaming for rest, but there was no comfort here. I wasn’t even shocked anymore—just… resigned. Resigned to this twisted game Draven played, to the inevitable end that loomed over me.

The silence pressed in, thick and suffocating, until Draven’s voice sliced through it—sharp, cruel, and dripping with amusement.

“So… should we end this?”

His words were poison, meant to twist the knife deeper. 

I should’ve been afraid. I should’ve been terrified, struggling, fighting, anything—but I was beyond that. His words didn’t even have the power to shock me anymore. They were just another cruel reminder of my helplessness, of how completely I had been broken.

Then I saw it—the way he raised his hand. Slow. Calculated. The flick of his wrist as he made a mocking, slow slashing motion through the air.

He taunted me, casually attempting to conjure a wind slash like before, though I could tell it was just a show. Rising from his seat, he started walking toward me.

As Draven closed in, I did the only thing I could—I poured what little essence I had left across my entire body, trying to harden it like armor. My instincts screamed at me to survive, to do something. Just as I was talking another jump forward, everything stopped.

My vision went dark. Emptiness. A pitch-black void, like the world itself had vanished.

I found myself in some sort of nucleus—whatever this was. And in the middle of that nothingness… a light.

A glowing, golden sphere. Small. Pulsing. Floating.

It radiated with essence so pure, so immense, it made the air around it hum. I could feel the hum, like the sound after a bell rings, those peaceful vibrations that settle deep in your chest. I couldn’t move. Couldn’t breathe. And yet, I couldn’t tear my eyes away from that glowing light. I could only watch. And somehow, I knew—it wasn’t just essence. It was something beyond my comprehension. Something deeper. Something alive, yet not life.

Before I could even think to look at it any longer—before I could act—the vision vanished.
