Chapter 4: The Remnants

*And here we are now. Remember when I said I was crippled?* *Yeah—this is how it happened.*

I’ve been under medical treatment for the past two weeks. My arms and legs—gone. But not forever. A Master Healer from Lucial is on their way today. There’s still hope. They say it’s possible to restore what was lost… physically, at least.

As for what happened after I made it out of the cave?

That scene was chaos. Vale guards found me just beyond the cave’s exit—barely breathing, half-dead, and still clutching Draven’s skull like my life depended on it. His head had disintegrated in the sunlight, but his body remained deep within the cave. A full-scale search was launched afterward. That place… it turned out to be a lair. Draven had been using it to hold his victims, to feed on them, torture them, kill them. The things they found… I still can’t get them out of my head.

Everyone’s been asking the same question—just not out loud.

How did I survive?

How did I manage to kill a vampire so powerful no one had even found—let alone captured or killed him—in the last thirteen years?

How did a barely-trained kid *decapitate* him?

Lucian, my father, has been seething ever since. But not at me. At *everything*. Still, he hasn’t pushed me to talk. Neither has Cedric. Orion came to visit, and even he didn’t ask what happened. Maybe they think I’m in shock. Maybe they’re giving me space. Or maybe… they’re just afraid of the answer.

Truth is, I haven’t told anyone. Not because I don’t trust them—but because I *don’t know how*. I don’t even fully understand it myself. What happened in that cave… what happened *inside* me… it’s not something I can just explain.

Because here’s the thing—if I really awakened a second Primordium, that’s not normal. At all. Dual-Primordium users are identified early, usually by age five, when their essence begins to form distinctly. But me? Mine just… *happened*. In the middle of a life-or-death moment, with no warning, no buildup.

And worse… it wasn’t just any Primordium. It was Reality Influence.

I’ve never even *heard* of someone awakening a second Primordium like that—much less *this* kind. There are no records. No precedents. Nothing.

So now, I’m taking my time. Thinking. Choosing my words carefully. Figuring out what to reveal… and what to keep buried.

Lillian—Mom—she’s been a wreck, doing everything she possibly can since the moment they found me. Alfred hasn’t left my side, not even once. He hovers like a hawk, always watching, always ready. Chris has been drowning in guilt—for not raising the alarm the moment he saw me being taken. Reus too, he's been quieter than usual, blaming himself in his own way. But right now… none of that really matters to me.

*I know they want answers—even if they haven’t asked directly, it’s there in their eyes.*

For now better focus on the healing that I’m about to receive. 

A renowned healer from the Lucial Domain is coming—no, not just any healer. *A master.*

Wounds that baffled entire medical corps… injuries deemed irreversible… she’s healed them like they were scratches. Her name carries weight not just in Lunaris, but across all of Avalon.

They say she once restored a soldier who had been burned down to the bone. Another tale speaks of her reviving a boy whose heart had *stopped* for three whole minutes.

And now… she’s coming for *me*.

Somehow, Dad and Orion managed to convince her. I don’t know how. But whatever they did, it worked. She’s on her way. 

**Her name is Aurelia Gin.**

### A Touch of Divine

I was in my chambers, lost in my own thoughts, when Alfred stepped in and informed me—*she* had arrived.

Aurelia Gin, the Master Healer herself, was finally here. In less than an hour, she would begin the treatment.

Father was already with her, and Orion too. No doubt Orion had to pull more than a few strings to make this happen—after all, she hailed from Lucial, and bringing someone of her stature wasn’t something done lightly.

If this failed—if I couldn’t recover my arm and leg—then all this… this newfound power, this strange phenomenon that had awakened inside me, would mean little.

It would be like receiving a miracle only to be *chained by it*. A gift that came at the cost of everything that let me stand.

An hour later, Lillian and Lucian stepped into my chamber. Right behind them came Orion—and her.

**Aurelia Gin**.

Even if no one had told me, I would’ve known it was her the moment she entered. She carried a *majestic* presence, the kind that made the air feel heavier. Her long, midnight-black hair flowed behind her like liquid shadow, her fair skin glowing softly in the afternoon light. Her eyes—piercing, intelligent, and sharp—scanned the room like she already owned it.

And then she opened her mouth.

*"Brat, you look like roadkill. What the hell happened to you?"*

Yep. Foul-mouthed, just as I’d heard. Blunt as a warhammer. No filter, no pretense. She knew a vampire was behind this, but still had to toss a jab.

I just offered her a crooked smile. *“Yeah, well… things went south real quick. Now here I am—crippled and waiting on a miracle. Think you can help a poor bastard out?”*

She snorted, unimpressed, and with zero hesitation walked up and placed her hand on my abdomen.

I thought I knew what to expect. I figured she was a Manifestor, maybe one who could channel her Essence into a patient’s body, guide tissue to regrow, rebuild nerves, stuff like that. A high-level application of standard healing.

But no.

What she did next shattered everything I thought I knew.

It wasn’t growth. It wasn’t reconstruction. It was like my body remembered what it once was and obeyed. Like she *commanded* my cells to revert to their original, unharmed state. Not restore. Not rebuild.

*Revert.*

I could feel it.

My cells, my muscles, my bones—every single fragment of me began to *reverse*. It wasn’t just growth. It was like my body was *rewinding*, tissue by tissue, nerve by nerve, to how it had been before I got maimed. What she did wasn’t Manifestation. She was a Reality Influencer, bending the very fabric of existence like it was clay in her hands

The sensation was unreal. My leg—it *grew back*, nerve endings reconnecting, skin stretching, bones aligning. My arm followed. I felt whole again, like my body was remembering what it used to be and simply *becoming* that again.

But then… panic struck me.

*Wait. If she’s rewinding my body… what happens to the Primordium I awakened?*

 What if it vanished along with the wounds?

Without thinking, I swatted her hand away.

Everyone froze.

Aurelia blinked, stunned for a split second—then her face twisted into mild irritation.

*"Sit your ass down, brat! Are you trying to die crippled and stupid? Sit still before I fix you with a hammer!"*

But I wasn’t listening. I had one thing on my mind.

I snapped my fingers.

**BOOM.**

**Spatial Realm**

That’s the name I gave to my second Primordium. After that life-or-death moment in the cave, it was the only reason I’d made it out alive .But what is Spatial Realm? How does it actually work?
Since returning, I’ve been into my chambers all the time and for obvious reasons. Because of that I was constantly testing, theorizing, trying to make sense of it all. The core idea is this: the Realm only covers a limited area. Back in the cave, I activated it in a small, closed-off space—barely the size of this chamber, maybe even smaller. And it worked. But here, in my room, it only stretches to about a five-meter radius.
What happens inside the Realm? That’s the real mystery.
All I know is that when it’s activated… time—or whatever governs cause and effect—ceases to move. Everything freezes. Everything but me. It’s like the entire world pauses while I keep moving.Apples hung midair as if caught in invisible threads. Water halted mid-pour, its droplets frozen like glass beads. Candles stopped flickering. Even the flicker of my own shadow vanished. I tossed a pebble once, and it just hung there, motionless, like the laws of physics had taken a break.
The catch? It only lasts two seconds. Two real-time seconds. In those moments, I’m untouchable—unstoppable. But after that, the Realm collapses, and reality resumes like nothing ever happened.
If I can master it… hone it… or control what I can do within them—I’m not just talking survival anymore. I’m talking something far greater.

2 Second passed

**BOOM** 
Yup—my second Primordium was still there. Rewinding my body didn’t undo it. Whatever force awakened that power… it wasn’t tied to just flesh and bone. It wasn’t going to vanish just because my physical state reverted. It was deeper—woven into my essence now.
With an annoyed sigh, Aurelia placed her hand back on my stomach and resumed the healing. Slowly, steadily, in just ten to fifteen minutes, my arms and legs began returning—cell by cell, nerve by nerve. It was nothing short of a miracle.
Even though I had endured these injuries without breaking down, a quiet fear had lingered inside me: What if they didn’t heal the same? What if something was permanently lost? But deep down, I knew it was possible. Dad had once lost an arm in battle, and now? There’s not even a scar. So yeah, I knew healing like this existed… I just never expected someone like her to be the one saving me.
With genuine gratitude, “Thank you, Aurelia. Truly. For healing me, for helping me get back to the way I was. I won’t forget this. If you ever need me—anytime—I’ll be there.”
Aurelia gave a soft snort, rolling her eyes with a smirk. “Yeah, sure. That time will probably never come. And why would I ever need help from a kid?” With that, she spun on her heel and walked out, my dad and Orion trailing behind her.
And then, for the first time since the nightmare began…I saw it.
Relief. In Mom’s eyes. In Dad’s. In Alfred’s.
A heavy weight had lifted from all of them—as if they’d been holding their breath for weeks, and now, finally, they could exhale.
