Chapter 4: Donford Outing

Two years had passed in a blur. I had gone from barely crawling to walking—then running—and before anyone knew it, I was talking in full sentences. The estate was never quiet anymore, filled with my laughter, my attempts at sneaking away from the maids, and my endless questions. But for all the things I learned, there was one thing that still hadn’t happened. My Primordium hadn’t awakened.

Celestia, on the other hand, had just turned nine, and she was already powerful. Strong in a way that made people stare. She could do things no other child her age could, and everyone knew it. Even Father. Even the knights. They tried not to compare us, but they didn’t have to—I could see it.

Outside the estate, the world was shifting. The Black Veil Incident had left Lunaris uneasy, and Father had been in constant meetings with Lord Cedric Vale. He was preparing to travel to Dunford to handle the situation. Celestia was going with him.

When news of Celestia’s visit reached Stephanie, her excitement was instant. It had been far too long since they last saw each other, and the thought of spending time together again filled her with anticipation.

She was learning about politics, about noble alliances and power. Father was teaching her himself, guiding her through things that I didn’t fully understand. She was meant for it, I suppose.

On the day they left, the carriage stood waiting, guarded by knights. Father spoke to Celestia as they climbed in, his voice steady, teaching even now. She listened, but her gaze was distant.

I stood by the entrance, watching the carriage move down the road until it was gone.

### **Arrival in Dunford**

As their carriage rolled past Dunford’s towering gates, Celestia peered out, taking in the sight of the city. Unlike Riverton, a hub of commerce, Dunford was a stronghold, built for war and strategy. Soldiers patrolled the streets, their disciplined presence a reflection of the Vale family's influence. Even the air felt different here—charged with the unspoken weight of battle-hardened history.

When they finally arrived at the Vale Mansion, they were greeted by Cedric and his family. Standing beside him, Stephanie practically bounced on her feet, her excitement barely contained.

The moment Celestia stepped down from the carriage, Stephanie rushed forward and hugged her.

"*I've missed you so much!*" she beamed. "*We have so much to catch up on!*"

Celestia chuckled at her enthusiasm. *"You act like it’s been years!"*

"*It feels like it!*" Stephanie huffed dramatically, then grabbed Celestia’s wrist. "*Come on, let’s go! I’ll show you everything new in Dunford!"*

That afternoon, the two wandered through the bustling market district, weaving between vendors calling out their wares. The streets were filled with the rich aroma of roasted meat, fresh bread, and exotic spices. Musicians played lively tunes in the background, and children dashed about, playing games between merchant stalls.

Yet, despite the lively atmosphere, Celestia seemed distant.

Noticing this, Stephanie nudged her. "*What’s wrong, Celi? You don’t seem to be having fun.*"

Snapping out of her thoughts, Celestia hesitated before replying, her voice quieter than before. "*It’s nothing… I’m happy we're doing this, really. But for the past month, I’ve been struggling with my training.*" She exhaled, her fingers clenching slightly.

Stephanie tilted her head. "*Struggling? You? That’s a first*," she teased, but when Celestia didn’t respond with her usual smirk, her playful expression shifted to concern.

Celestia frowned slightly, glancing down at her palm. "*I can coat my body with my elemental aura, but it’s still too weak. And no matter how much I try, I can’t extend it to objects. I’ve trained every day, tested every method, and still... nothing. It should be simple by now, but I feel like I'm stuck, like something is missing.*"

She let out a frustrated sigh before shaking her head, forcing a small smile. "*Never mind that. I’ll figure it out later. For now, let’s go eat pancakes.*"

Stephanie watched her for a moment, then broke into a grin. "*Celi, you’re the strongest friend I have! Even my big brother Luke is weaker than you." She nudged Celestia playfully. "Don’t stress about it—you’ll get there. You always do! And when you do, you’ll probably master it so well that no one will be able to keep up. So stop worrying!*"

Celestia blinked at her before chuckling softly. "*You really think so?*"

Stephanie rolled her eyes. *"Of course! I wouldn’t lie to you. Now, let’s go! I’m starving*!" She grabbed Celestia’s wrist and tugged her forward.

For a moment, Celestia let herself be pulled along, the warmth of her friend’s words pushing away the weight of her frustrations. Maybe she was overthinking it. Maybe, just maybe, she would figure it out—just like she always had.

And for now, pancakes sounded like a pretty good distraction.

Meanwhile, in the grand hall of Vale’s castle, Lucian and Cedric sat across from each other, their discussion stretching into its third hour. The atmosphere was tense, the gravity of their words evident in their expressions. Alfred stood nearby, his sharp gaze observing every detail, while Vale’s personal swordsman remained stationed at the entrance, a silent guardian to the high-stakes conversation.

The Black Veil Incident had shaken the entire nation. Reports of abandoned villages, livestock slaughtered, and entire populations vanishing without a trace had unsettled even the most hardened leaders. Cedric exhaled, his fingers tapping lightly against the armrest of his chair. “The more we investigate, the less we understand. My scouts returned with fragmented reports—whispers in the dark, shadows moving unnaturally. None of it makes sense. Some of them didn’t even made it back. A Black rose is the only link we have.”

Lucian’s eyes darkened. “*If this continues, fear will consume the people before the enemy even reveals itself. We need answers, Cedric. And we need them soon.*”

A heavy silence filled the room. Neither of them had an answer—only the certainty that whatever lurked in the darkness was far from ordinary.

Breaking the tense silence, Cedric leaned back with a knowing smirk. "*So, what’s the deal with Celestia? Not only has she manifested one of the rarest elements, but her growth rate is downright monstrous. At this pace, your daughter might just surpass you before she even reaches her twenties.*"

Lucian exhaled slowly, his fingers tapping rhythmically against the armrest. His gaze drifted toward the grand windows, where the evening light filtered through. A flicker of emotion crossed his face—pride, concern, and something deeper. "*That’s exactly what worries me,*" he muttered, his voice carrying an unspoken weight.

Cedric raised an eyebrow. "*Worries you? That should be a damn blessing, Lucian. A prodigy like her—*"

Lucian cut him off with a slight shake of his head. "*Prodigies attract attention. The kind of attention I don't want on my daughter. You and I both know that talent alone isn’t always a gift—it’s a beacon, and not everyone who takes notice has good intentions.*" His voice was steady, but Cedric could hear the edge in it.

A brief silence settled between them before Lucian sighed, running a hand through his hair. "*Talk about something else.*"

Cedric chuckled but didn’t push further, sensing Lucian wasn’t ready to dwell on the topic. Instead, he shifted gears, his tone turning more thoughtful. "*I’m sending Stephanie and Serina to the capital soon. A close friend of mine will be mentoring them—a renowned Archmage Manifestor. It’s a year-long expedition, it’ll surely sharpen their abilities and give them exposure to the world beyond our domains.*" He paused for a moment before adding, "*If you truly want Celestia to grow stronger, why not let her go too? She’ll gain experience, face new challenges, and refine her skills under someone I trust completely.*"

Lucian’s expression remained neutral, but his eyes narrowed slightly. "*A Manifestor training an Essence Manipulator?*" he though in his mind and was about to question that’s when Cedric caught on to the hesitation and leaned forward with a sly grin. "*I know what you’re thinking—how could a Manifestor possibly help someone like Celestia?*" His voice dipped slightly, laced with amusement. "*Because she’s not just a Manifestor. **She’s a dual-nexus user*.**"
