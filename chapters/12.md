Chapter 12: Spatial Realm

**BOOM…..**

For a second, it felt like the entire world held its breath. The air felt heavy—thick. Draven? Mid-swing, arm stretched out like he was about to deliver that final, mocking blow. His eyes still gleamed with that smug satisfaction.

Water? Droplets just hanging there, suspended in midair. Like the world forgot how to fall.

The flames of the torches? Frozen, too. They didn’t flicker. Didn’t dance. The whole cave went still, silent.

And then, the strangest part? Even Draven’s heartbeat—gone. Nothing.

For exactly two seconds—it was like everything took a pause. Like the universe hit *stop* and left me behind, still breathing, still thinking, and still *freaking out* inside my head.

And then— **BOOM.**

Time snapped back. The air rushed back into my lungs, and the world came alive again. Water splattered to the ground. The torches flickered. Draven’s arm jerked forward, his cocky expression still in place like he hadn’t just been frozen in time.

But me? I was standing there, completely dazed, my heart racing, trying to make sense of what the hell just happened. Did—did I just freeze time? Is that even possible?

I felt it. I *knew* something had changed. But I couldn’t put it into words. It was like my body had done something it shouldn’t be able to do. Something no one should be able to do. *But I had.*

I didn’t know why or how. But it happened.

And whatever it was? It felt *big*. Too big for me to ignore. I had no clue what it meant, but I knew, in the back of my mind, it was gonna change everything. Change me.

I shook myself out of it. Had to. No time to think. Because Draven, clueless as ever, didn’t even realize what just happened. He was still in full mock mode, trying to push my buttons like it was another damn game.

But then—he felt it. He faltered. Just a tiny, imperceptible shift in his demeanor. He felt *something*. It was too quick for me to catch, but I knew that look. His confidence was a little shaken, just for a second. His eyes narrowed.

Then, without warning, he went all in. No more playtime. No more fakes. His aura flared up in his arm—this time, the strike was real. No games.

“*Well, I’m done with you now,*” Draven sneered, his voice dripping with malice. He raised his hand, fingers curling like claws, the air around him crackling with lethal intent.

I wasn’t ready. I wasn’t thinking.

My brain was still whirling with what had just happened. But then, instinct kicked in. Pure, raw survival.

I had no time. I didn’t even stop to think.

**SNAP.**

**BOOM.**

Time froze again.

Draven’s attack hung in midair, suspended inches from my face. His grin, still plastered on, his eyes wide with that same smug look. But this time, he had no clue what had just gone down. He was still there, motionless, like someone pressed *pause* on his whole existence.

*This is my chance.*

I didn’t waste a second. My body moved before my brain could catch up. I dove to the side, barely missing the slash by inches. Time snapped back into place. 

**BOOM**

 …..and the world resumed like nothing happened. But Draven? He stepped forward like he’d won, sure that I was just another casualty, another easy kill.

But I wasn’t where he thought I’d be.

***Impossible**.*

He blinked. Eyes narrowing, confused. He took a step back, his brow furrowing in disbelief. His eyes flicked to the space where I *should* have been, and for the first time, I saw something on his face—*doubt*.

He couldn’t wrap his head around it. No way in hell could someone like me have dodged that attack. There was no way I was fast enough, not with the difference between his speed and mine. But here I was. Alive. Standing.

And Draven? He couldn’t figure it out. His confidence was cracked, and for a brief moment, he was left with nothing but questions.

And I—*I*—wasn’t done yet.

Annoyance flashed across Draven’s face, his lips curling into a sneer. It shifted into frustration, his sharp eyes narrowing. The confusion only deepened. He couldn’t make sense of what had just happened.

I, on the other hand, was *lost*. My mind was a **storm of chaos**, a swirling mess of panic and confusion. What the hell *did* I just do? I didn’t have time to think it through, but I knew one thing for sure—if I didn’t figure out how to kill or, at the very least, incapacitate Draven *right now*, I was dead.

I wasn’t fooling myself. I couldn’t keep dodging his attacks forever. Wounding him wasn’t going to cut it. Not with someone like Draven. He’d figure it out, adapt, and come back stronger. If I didn’t end this now, I wouldn’t get another chance.

I swallowed hard. My whole body screamed for rest, but the fight was still on. My only option? To finish it. *Now.*

The silence between us was suffocating, thick with tension. Time seemed to stretch out like a rubber band pulled too far, waiting to snap.

Finally, Draven spoke. His voice was cold, venom lacing each word.

“Brat, what the hell did you just do? And how?”

I didn’t flinch, didn’t even blink. My expression was flat, blank. As if this was just another bad day. “What are you talking about?”

His eyes darkened, narrowing with that deadly focus. “Don’t play dumb. You *dodged* my attack. If you had this ability, why didn’t you avoid my last two hits? Tell me the truth, or I’ll make sure your death is the most agonizing thing you could ever imagine.”

I knew Draven. He didn’t want answers. He wanted to *break me*. But I couldn’t afford to mess this up. A reckless answer would only make him angry—*angrier*. The last thing I needed was to set him off more.

I paused. Gritting my teeth, I gave him just enough to keep him from going ballistic. “I saw it coming.”

It wasn’t a lie. I *had* seen it coming. Just not in the way Draven would ever understand.

Draven clicked his tongue in frustration, the sound echoing through the cave. Without another word, he began to walk toward me, his steps heavy, deliberate. Each one felt like a hammer against my chest.

I had seconds to think. As Draven closed the distance between us, my mind raced, spinning. I had to kill him. Not just hurt him. Not just keep him busy. He had to be *ended*.

A simple punch wouldn’t cut it. Hell, even piercing his heart wouldn’t be enough—vampires like Draven were built differently. They didn’t die like that.

I remembered hearing stories about vampires and how sunlight was their true weakness, but in this cave, surrounded by pitch-black darkness? Sunlight wasn’t going to help me here.

A wooden stake through the heart might immobilize him, but it wouldn’t kill him. And I sure as hell wasn’t going to be able to conjure one on the fly, not with my aura almost gone.

*If only I were a Manifestation user…* That’s what Zane always said. Conjure something, a weapon out of thin air, just like that. But I wasn’t. I had to work with what I had.

Then, it hit me.

*Decapitation.*
