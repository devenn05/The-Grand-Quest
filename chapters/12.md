"Someone’s near me, Ronan, Aurora. I can’t sense them... can’t see them... but someone’s hitting me—be caref—"

Before I could finish, another punch slammed into my gut.

This time, I'd half-expected it. I shifted my body at the last second, letting the strike glance off as I stumbled backward, the momentum killing some of the impact. Still, it hurt like hell. Whoever this was—they weren't just good at hiding, they were fast. And strong.

One thing was clear now.

They were using some kind of ability—either bending light to become invisible or the damn mist itself was playing tricks on my senses.

I didn’t wait to find out which. I turned and sprinted in the opposite direction, forcing as much space as I could between me and the the one who kept landing punches.

The guy in the cloak... the one creating this mist...is probably the who’s behind this punches too.

If I can find him, I can stop this.

I forced my mind to focus. Manipulators might be looked down on compared to Manifestors or Reality Shifters, but if there’s one thing we’re good at—it's feeling the flow of Essence.

Closing my eyes briefly, I felt it.

Four distinct flows.

Three of them were strong, almost fully formed cores. One of them had to be Ronan—and the other two, probably those bastards. But I couldn’t tell which was which just from sensing.

Damn it.

For now, I’ll regroup with Aurora.

She might not have her core fully formed yet, but the raw volume of her Essence... it's much more than mine. It stand out.

"Aurora, it’s me! I’m coming toward you—don’t attack!" I shouted through the mist.

But when I reached her, the words caught in my throat.

Aurora was lying on the ground, blood pooling around her. Her cloak was ripped open at her stomach, where a deep, brutal gash carved across her side. Blood leaked between her fingers as she tried to keep pressure on it, her face pale, her breath shallow.

Her eyes barely flickered open when she heard me approach.

"Summer..." she croaked, voice cracking. "Be careful. One of them... uses his Essence to shape invisible daggers... fast... I couldn't even see it coming..."

Each word was a struggle for her.

It hit me harder than any punch.

This isn't some sparring match. This is real. She could die.

I dropped to my knees beside her, trying to keep my voice steady.

"Don't speak. Just stay down, focus on staying awake," I said, pressing her hand harder over the wound. "I'll find Ronan. I'll help him stop them. Just hold on."

No time to waste.

I needed Ronan—and fast.

I thought quickly.

Their Essence pools felt nearly identical in size—but maybe, just maybe, Ronan would respond if I reached out.

"Ronan, it's Summer! If you can hear me—respond!"

I kept my voice low but urgent, hoping he’d pick it up.

Out of the three moving Essences around me, one broke off and started heading straight for me. Other two started heading toward each other.

I stayed perfectly still.

Didn’t run.

Didn’t attack.

My visibility was barely two to three meters in this cursed mist—if whoever was coming entered that range, I could check them without risking an ambush.

The moment I felt them step into range, I silently activated Spatial Realm—and got my answer.

It was Ronan.

I froze in place, letting him spot me without giving away what I just did.

He approached fast and low, speaking in a gruff hiss under his breath.

"Don't shout like that, you brat," he snapped. "And what the hell was that just now? Your Essence fluctuated—did you use some kind of attack?"

Shit.

Of course he'd notice. He’s a Manipulator too.

I can’t let him know about Spatial Realm.

"No... it wasn’t an attack—"

Before I could even finish explaining, something shot toward us, slicing through the mist like a bullet.

Ronan moved without hesitation.

I barely caught it with my eyes—

His entire body shimmered, the color of his skin shifting into a gleaming silver sheen, like polished steel.

The incoming projectile—whatever it was—slammed into his chest and simply bounced off, leaving him standing there without even a scratch.

“We have to find the user who spread this mist. If we take him down, the fight’ll be a hell of a lot easier. And I think…” I take a breath, steadying myself. “I think he can turn invisible in this mist. Someone punched me twice—I couldn’t see shit. Either he’s invisible, or he’s messing with my senses.”

I force the next words out.

“Aurora’s hurt bad. Real bad. We don’t have much time.”

For a second, something shifts across Ronan’s face—a flash of pure fury. It’s like the air around him tenses with it. No yelling, no outburst. Just cold, dangerous anger.

“Stay here. Don’t move unless you have to. Only make noise if you’re about to die,” he says, voice cutting sharp and low. “I’ll end this.”

“Okay,” I answer immediately. No arguments. I know exactly why he’s leaving me behind—taking me would only slow him down.

I’m weak.

If I didn’t have Spatial Realm, I’d have no hope of surviving.

And if Ronan falls...

Well, then I’m most likely dead. Or worse.

I tighten my fists and stay still as he vanishes into the mist.

Minutes drag by, thick with tension.

Then—thuds, grunts, the sharp snap of impact. Punches, bodies hitting sand, the mist around me shivering with the force of it.

The fog finally starts thinning, peeling away like wet cloth. My sight clears enough to make out blurred figures ahead.

Ronan stands in the open. Blood streaks down the side of his face, dripping from his hand.

Across from him, two figures—one crumpled unconscious on the ground, the other still upright, grinning like a wolf. Not a scratch on him.

The bastard’s practically smirking despite his fallen comrades.

Ronan without wasting a second. He lunges forward, fast and brutal.

And then I see it—the thing I missed before. The thing Aurora tried to warn us about.

The enemy lifts his hand, and the air around it twists—forming razor-thin daggers of condensed wind, flickering with essence. They launch at Ronan with vicious speed, like arrows fired from invisible bows.

Essence-forged weapons.

Fast, dense, and lethal.

Could I survive even one of those if I hardened my body with essence?

No. It would tear right through me.

Ronan moving like a beast, dodging the first volley easily. He shifts his stance, grounding himself, preparing to strike again.

His voice cuts through the clearing mist.

“I’m asking you again. Who the hell are you? Why are you attacking us?”

The smirking bastard laughs—a dry, ugly sound.

“What’s it gonna change?” he sneers. “Give up already. You think taking out a two rats means anything?”

More wind-daggers whip toward Ronan. He ducks, sidesteps, weaving through them with brutal efficiency.

I tear my eyes away, scanning for Aurora.

There—collapsed a few meters away, barely breathing.

I sprint to her side, heart hammering. Her face is pale, her breathing shallow. Blood stains the sand beneath her.

I tear a strip of cloth from my tunic, pressing it tightly against her wound. My hands are shaking, but I keep working, tying the makeshift bandage around her torso as firmly as I can.

It won’t heal her. It might not even buy her much time.

But it’s the only damn thing I can do.

As a manipulator I could somewhat heal myself or at least stop the bleeding to a certain point, but manifestors or binders can’t do that.

Gently, I lift her onto a nearby rock, propping her up. All while keeping my eyes flicking back to Ronan’s fight.

The battle rages on.

Technique-wise, Ronan’s better—way better. He’s reading the enemy’s moves, dodging, conserving energy. The wind-daggers, while dangerous, aren’t landing solid hits.

But closing the distance... that’s the real problem.

Every time he tries, another barrage of blades forces him back.

It’s a brutal, even match—and every second that ticks by, the balance threatens to tilt.

The battle raged on like a storm trapped in a bottle. Ronan lunged forward, his entire body hardened into a dark metallic sheen, Essence roaring through his veins like molten iron. 

Slashes tearing into the sand, slicing jagged scars across the ground as Ronan barely dodged. Every time he moved, it felt like he was fighting against the wind itself. One dagger clipped his side, glancing off the steel-like defense but still sending a thin spray of blood into the air.

Ronan gritted his teeth, shifting weight, exploding forward with a brutal kick that the man barely twisted away from. Another barrage of wind daggers came flying, this time from above. Ronan crossed his arms, taking the blows head-on, the impact echoing like dull hammers against iron. Sparks flared where the essence clashed, but the man didn’t relent — faster, sharper, more ruthless by the second.

Ronan needed to get closer.

But the bastard kept dancing just out of reach.

It seemed balanced—until the tip turned.

Suddenly, the man launched an attack Ronan couldn’t pick up. Till now, even I could spot the daggers coming as they carried Essence, and even though their speed was fast, it was manageable to dodge them, but this time the presence of this dagger was hidden, and even though Ronan’s body was coated with Essence, rock solid, the dagger went past his lower side, right through his stomach.

It was painful to watch as blood started gushing out of it. Ronan fell to his knees.

Without wasting a moment, the man launched another attack, same this time too—I couldn’t see or sense his dagger. A clean hit on Ronan’s knees, making him fall flat on his face into the sand.

The man walked closer and closer to Ronan.

I didn’t know what I could do to make any difference. Without thinking carefully, I ran towards him. Just as I was closing in, a cat appeared in front of Ronan.

 A light silver-gray cat, her fur sleek and unblemished. One eye gleamed a bright blue, the other a rich brown — a strange, striking contrast that somehow made her seem even more otherworldly.

I was confused. Ronan was confused. And the man, too, froze—until he burst out laughing.

“Finally found it. Julian would go crazy after finding out that I found her first.”

He instantly ran toward the cat. I was confused—what was he talking about? Find her? Why? And mainly, Julian? Was he talking about Aurora’s master? But how would he know him?

I could also see questions twisting Ronan’s face.

“Julian? Do you mean Julian Silva? Is he with y—”

Smashed.

I couldn’t understand what happened. Just a second ago, he was standing.

And now—his body was smashed, completely burst open, all his organs lying scattered across the sand. Both of his comrades were in the same condition. I couldn’t understand what had just happened.

The cat started walking toward Aurora.

“No... don't. Don't hurt her”, Ronan screamed, his voice breaking.

Why is he screaming at the cat?

He started dragging himself like a worm toward Aurora and the cat.

I asked, “What are you doing? How are these guys dead? And Why are you screaming?”

“She’s the one who did this to them, Summer! The one we kept feeling stalking us—yes, it’s her. I don't know what her intentions are, but she's heading straight to Aurora.”

My body froze.

What?

How?

This cat did this?

How did she hide her presence from us?

Thousands of questions flooded my mind as I saw her closing in on Aurora. In a matter of seconds, she was standing on the same rock as Aurora. Ronan was almost screaming, tears spilling as he dragged himself.

And then—what I saw was unbelievable.

The cat placed her paw gently on Aurora’s body.

A bright light bloomed, breaming Essence into Aurora’s body. Healing her.

I was dead frozen.

Her Essence pool, her core—

A complete Essence Core.

This cat... had the core of a full-stage Ascendant.
