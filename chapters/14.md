Chapter 14: Ashes to Dust

"*WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!*" Draven’s voice **roared** with a fury that shook the cave walls. **"*YOU FILTHY BRAT—WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO ME?!*"**

His screams were relentless, filled with blind **rage** and **agony.**

But Summer wasn’t listening.

With Draven’s head in hand, he turned and **ran.**

There was **only one way out of this cave.**

He didn’t know how long it would take, or what dangers still lay ahead. He only knew **one thing:**

**If he could expose Draven’s head to sunlight, it would finally be over.**

His body **ached.** His **one remaining leg** burned with exhaustion, but he pushed forward—**limping, stumbling, running.**

Behind him, Draven’s head **raged.**

“*RETURN ME TO MY BODY, YOU WORTHLESS TRASH! DO YOU THINK YOU’VE WON?!*”

Summer ignored him and **kept running.**

But one thought **terrified him.**

*What if Draven used a portal to bring his head back to his body? What if he teleported Summer along with it?*

It was a **risk**—but Summer had no choice.

He had destroyed **Draven’s senses,** and it seemed to be working. The vampire was **blind, deaf, disoriented.**

And then—

**A light.**

A **bright, distant glow.**

Summer’s breath caught in his throat.

The **exit.**

For the first time in what felt like an eternity, **tears** welled in his eyes.

A feeling—one he couldn’t even put into words—**rushed through his chest.**

He was **almost there.**

Draven, still clueless, continued his **furious, mindless screams.**

But then—

**Summer stepped out.**

For the first time in hours, **sunlight** kissed his skin.

And **Draven’s head…**

The moment it met the sunlight—

**It burned.**

Draven’s **rage** turned into **pure agony.**

“*NO—NOOOO! WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!*”

His flesh **sizzled.** Smoke **rose** from his skull.

His **screams** became inhuman, echoing through the mountains.

And then—

**Ash.**

His skin **crumbled away.** His flesh **disintegrated.**

All that remained—

**Was a blackened, lifeless skull.**

Summer stared at it, still clenched in his hand.

A deep, shaky sigh escaped his lips.

And then—

**His body gave out.**

His legs collapsed beneath him.

And there, in the warmth of the sun—

**Summer passed out.**

Draven’s skull still clutched in his grip.
