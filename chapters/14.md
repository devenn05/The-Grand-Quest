"Get up, Summer. Get up." 

I scrub my eyes, still tangled in sleep and confusion. Shapes blur into focus—Ronan and Aurora are already packing up. Skye’s curled up on top of me. The sun hasn’t even touched the horizon yet.

"Pack up, Summer. We’re starting. Training," Ronan says, excitement flickering in his eyes.

That one word—training—wakes me more than any sunrise could.

I snap into motion, throw on my boots, and finish getting ready. Aurora’s already packed, arms crossed, clearly not thrilled. Just as I strap my bag on, Ronan hits us with the first task.

"Start running. I’ll tell you when to stop. Until then—no stopping."

"WHAT??" Aurora scowls.

"That’s it?" I ask, unsure if he’s joking.

"Yup. That’s the first task I’m assigning you. I’ll give the next one when the time comes."

Aurora doesn’t hold back. "What is that supposed to change, Ronan? When I said I wanted to get stronger, I meant being able to stand my ground against someone stronger than me—not training to run away from them."

"Who’s teaching you to run away? Now stop complaining and start running. Stop doubting, and do what I told you to."

So this is the plan Ronan talked about. That’s how he expects us to reach Silverlake City in fifteen to twenty days. I wonder when I’ll reach the exact point I began this coastline journey from.

Skye is still sprawled across me, looking up with that smug expression, like she’s thinking, “Pick me up you damn slave. I’m your Queen. Do you expect me to run like you?”

I sigh. "Yes, Your Majesty," I mutter, scooping her up. She gives a little satisfied chirp. With her perched on my shoulder, I start running. Aurora groans, then follows.

"Now that we’re on the move," Ronan says, jogging easily beside me, "Summer, tell me what you know about Essence, the Essence Pool, and the Essence Core."

Then he glances back at Aurora. "And you stay alert. If I switch over to you, asked you a question and you miss it—no lunch. No water either."

"Yes, Ronan," Aurora says dryly.

I take a breath and start.

"Essence is the life force flowing through every being, whether they’ve awakened Primordium or not. Nobody survives without it. The Essence Pool is the total amount of essence a person holds inside their body. The Essence Core, though, is something only Primordium users can develop—because it takes precise control of essence to form. Without awakening, you can’t control essence consciously. A core is formed by accumulating essence into a single point instead of letting it spread out across your body. At first, it’s shapeless, but as control improves and your pool grows, the essence begins to compress into a stable form—an orb. When it finally becomes a perfectly condensed orb, that’s called an Essence Core. Forming one means you’ve reached Full Stage Ascendant."

Ronan grins. "Perfect. Since we’re both Manipulators, you can feel my core forming inside me. Compare it with your own—what’s the biggest difference?"

"My essence isn’t concentrated. Yours is. Just a tad bit uncondensed indicating you’re still not broken into full stage Ascendant."

"Right. Next question. What difference does forming a core actually make? Say your pool keeps growing, but you don’t form a core—what happens then?"

"Using essence becomes much harder. Say I try to channel a large amount into my arms—without a core, the essence has to travel through my whole body, which takes time. But if I had a core, it would shoot straight from the source. Quicker. Cleaner. More efficient."

"Exactly. Now, Aurora—what’s one thing we’ve discussed that you can’t do?"

"I can’t sense someone else’s Essence Core or their pool. Only Manipulators can do that," she answers confidently.

"Good. You are listening. Now Summer—how do you form a core?"

"By accumulating essence into a single point in your body."

"Yeah, but how? If you know that, why haven’t you done it yet?"

"I guess... by channeling essence into one spot and just keeping it there?"

Ronan scoffs. "If it were that easy, everyone would be Ascendant. What you're describing is like trying to hold water in your hands and hoping it shapes into a sphere. To form a core, your essence needs to be solidified first. So how do you do that?"

After thinking for a minute I replied, "From what I know, the core forms naturally as your pool increases and your control improves."

“That’s true. But it’s a slow process. Each time you use your Essence, exhaust it, and recover—your core gradually begins to assimilate it. Little by little. It’s steady, but it takes years. But there’s a way to speed it up—Aurora, you should know what I’m talking about."

"Resonance," Aurora says without missing a beat.

“What’s a resonance?” I asked.

“Resonance is a technique used to amplify the growth of your core. What is resonance? You have to force your body to exhaust your essence—take it to the lowest. The essence that you burn will recover again, and then you burn it again, and then recover again. Keep doing it. This also increases your essence pool. Remember you told me how your essence pool increased slightly when you were training your hardening technique? Yeah, that’s because of that. But since you never went below seventy percent, the growth wasn’t significant. Which brings me to the task I’m going to give you both now.”

“You want us to burn essence while running, don’t you?” Aurora asked.

“Bingo!” Ronan said.

“Just burn essence? Nothing else?” I asked.

“Do you want to do something else while at it?” Ronan replied sarcastically.

“My bad, I’ll do that.”

Immediately stopping me, he said, “And not just burn essence. I’ve set a target we need to hit. We have to reach Silverlake in the next twenty days. So you better run like your life depends on it while burning your essence as fast as you can.”

“Aurora could burn her essence with her manifestation attacks—that glass one. Why would she run?”

“She could, but our main objective is to reach Silverlake City. If all she did was exhaust and regain essence staying in one spot, we’d stay in the same place all the time. And if we decided to just exhaust essence and walk while regaining it, remember—the human body has limitations. It would greatly slow down the regaining of essence.”

Although it was easy for manipulators to burn down their essence, manifestors had it rough as Aurora now will have to see to it while manifesting that she doesn’t consume too much of her essence immediately as it will force us to stop.

“Okay, agreed. About Silverlake—how far is it from here?” I asked.

“Roughly about five hundred to six hundred kilometers. I can’t give you an exact figure, but yeah, around that.”

At this point, I’m not even surprised. He wants us to cover nearly five times the distance I managed in a month—and with almost ten days less to do it.

Without complaining, I start burning my essence.

How did I burn it? I simply release it out of my body. I do have a more efficient way to do it. But I can’t use that in front of these two. It’s not like I don’t trust them— I do. They’re good people. But I just don’t want too many people knowing about my second Primordium. God knows what could go wrong. Besides, even I don’t fully understand what I’ve awakened. So better to keep it to myself for now. So we ran. 

About three hours later, my essence gave out.

We’ve covered maybe fifteen to twenty kilometers. Aurora looks tired but still standing. Ronan? That damn Goliath doesn’t even look winded.

“Okay, so our current limit is three hours, I see,” he says, looking at me.

I immediately realize I’m holding them back.

Before I can even process that, Ronan turns to Aurora. “Aurora, start burning your essence through your attacks now. Burn it as quickly as you can.”

“Ahh... so this way both of our objectives are getting solved,” I say, piecing it together.

“Summer, do you know the best way to regain your essence?” Ronan asks.

“Meditation?” I answer. Alfred once told me that.

“Correct. Start doing it. Isolate yourself from here. Once your whole pool’s recovered, come back. I’ll ask Aurora to do the same when it’s her turn,” he says.

Without arguing, I head somewhat deeper into the coastal forest with Skye and start meditating.

Alfred told me that meditation works best for regaining essence because when you meditate, you start absorbing essence from your surroundings instead of fully relying on your body to generate it. That’s what makes the difference.

So I meditated.

For almost two hours, I sat there—until my essence pool was fully recovered.

Immediately, I went to inform Ronan. As soon as he came into view, I saw him sparring hand-to-hand with Aurora. It wasn’t a fight—it was a one-sided domination. She couldn’t land a hit. Couldn’t even defend herself. It was the worst kind of matchup. How could a Manifestor hope to match a Manipulator in close-quarters combat?

But as I got closer, I started to understand.

Ronan wasn’t using any Essence.

Aurora, on the other hand—although she couldn't channel Essence into her arms like us, coating herself in glass. She summoned it over her arms, legs, torso—wherever Ronan aimed. He shattered every layer without hesitation. Punch after punch, crack after crack. Her glass barely held up for half a second before his next strike came in. She tried reinforcing mid-fight, layering her arms, blocking with her forearms—but Ronan read her every move. His footwork didn’t belong to a brute. It was calculated. His strikes precise.

Aurora wasn't weak. Not at all. She fought smart, with everything she had.

But Ronan moved like a predator—and this wasn’t a spar.

It was a lesson.

Finally, after one last spin-kick that sent her crashing into the sand, Ronan stopped. He didn’t even look winded.

“Now get ready to run, Aurora. We’ll be repeating the whole process again.”

Again?

Wait.

She already burned her Essence once, meditated to recover it, had a brutal spar, and now she’s going to burn it again?

She has a bigger pool than me, how the hell did she regain her essence so fast?

"Did she already burn through her Essence once, recovered it, and now she’s burning it again?" I asked.

"Yeah," Ronan replied without even looking back.

I frowned. "How? How the hell is she recovering it that fast?"

He shot me a glance, raising an eyebrow like I’d just answered my own question. "Didn’t you say it yourself? Meditation."

"I meditated too," I muttered. "But my recovery was nowhere near that fast."

“Well, that’s what you get for being amongst the weakest race,” he said, finally facing me. “She’s an elf. Elves are loved by essence. They draw it faster. Us beastkin too—though not as much.”

Well, that explains it. I keep forgetting these two aren’t human. She’s an elf, he’s a beastkin.

“Now stop asking questions,” he said, grinning. “Let’s have a spar. Hand to hand.”

“Can I use my technique? Stonefist?” I asked.

“For all I care, you could use Steelfist or even Goldfist. Now come at me—we don’t have much time.”

“Here I come.”

I charged. Focused all the Essence I could into my arms. Stonefist activated—my arms hardened, dense as rock with cracks of energy running across. I threw a straight punch at his face.

He weaved under it.

I threw a hook—he stepped inside, brushing it off with his shoulder.

I kept striking, faster, harder. Right fist, left elbow, knee to the gut—nothing landed. Not one clean hit.

Then he struck.

A palm to my sternum—air left my lungs.

A hook to my temple—stars exploded in my vision.

A sweep took my legs. I hit the ground before I even saw it coming.

This was the difference.

This was the difference between a Kindle user and someone who was about to be a Full Stage Ascendant.

I could throw everything I had at him, and it wouldn’t matter. I was utterly defeated.

“The goal here is to gain real-time combat experience,” he said, offering me a hand up. “Now let’s move out. We’ve got almost three hours before sunset—perfect for us.”

And just like that, we started running again.

Burning essence while we moved.

When I ran dry, Ronan made me stop and meditate.

Once my pool was full, he dragged me into another spar under the setting sun and rising moon. Aurora did the same.

Today, we covered almost thirty-five to forty kilometers. And we did practice Resonance twice.

I can feel it—subtle but real. A faint pulse of extra strength inside. My Essence pool has grown.

This technique is crazy effective.

I wonder why Alfred or even Zane never told me about this.
