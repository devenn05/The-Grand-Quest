Chapter 3: Zane's Promise

Morning light spilled over the Williams estate, casting long golden rays as Lucian and Zane stepped onto the stone pathways. Their movements were unhurried, but there was a weight to them—**the kind only carried by men who had fought and bled on too many battlefields.**

Zane, never one for patience, finally glanced over. **"***So, what is it you wanted from me?***"**

Lucian smirked. **"***Before that, how about a spar?***"**

Zane sighed, shaking his head, but there was no real protest. **He should’ve known.** Within minutes, word spread like wildfire—Lucian Williams, the formidable Patriarch, was about to spar against Zane, the legendary former Lord Commander of Avalon. Servants whispered, guards abandoned their posts, and even the most seasoned warriors made their way to the training grounds.

This wasn’t just any duel. **This was a clash between titans.**

Lucian and Zane stood at the center of the training ring, their gazes locked. They were more than just master swordsmen—**they were Essence Manipulators, warriors who bent the very fabric of energy to their will.**

Zane—one of the top twenty Essence Manipulators in all of Avalon. A warrior whose battlefield instincts were **flawless,** his combat style a perfect balance of **brutal strength and precise execution.**

Lucian—a strategist without equal. His essence manipulation wasn’t about raw power but **unparalleled control.** His defensive mastery was **legendary,** his movements calculated to perfection.

The crowd held its breath.

Lucian’s voice was calm, controlled. **"***Begin.***"**

**The ground cracked beneath them.**

In an instant, they **vanished.**

Then—**steel met steel.**

The clash rang out like a thunderstrike, sparks flying as their blades locked. **Zane struck first—fast, precise, ruthless.** But Lucian? He was already ahead of him, each parry flowing like water, deflecting every attack with perfect efficiency. Even as he defended, his aura began to build.

Then—**he disappeared.**

A fraction of a second later, he was everywhere.

Lucian’s speed doubled. Then tripled. **Then surged tenfold.**

His movements became a blur, his attacks hitting from impossible angles. Each strike carried the weight of a hurricane, the force of an avalanche. **The air itself trembled under the sheer energy radiating from him.**

Zane gritted his teeth. **Monstrous.**

He had fought countless warriors, but this? This was different. **Every block sent shockwaves through his arms.** He had no openings—**Lucian wasn’t just attacking. He was dissecting him.**

The battle could have ended there—Lucian could have infused his strikes with elemental energy and overwhelmed Zane in an instant. But this wasn’t a war. **It was a test. A reminder. A challenge.**

Zane knew it too.

So—he shifted.

Unlike Lucian, who spread his essence evenly, Zane did something far more dangerous. **He funneled everything into his sword.**

The air turned suffocatingly heavy.

Onlookers felt their knees buckle as a wave of **pure killing intent** crashed over the battlefield.

Lucian exhaled, his instincts flaring. **He recognized this.** He had seen it before. And if he didn’t release his own aura now, he wouldn’t evade in time.

Then—**Zane vanished.**

He didn’t just move fast. **He ceased to exist for a fraction of a second.**

And when he reappeared—**he was already within striking distance.**

Lucian barely had time to react.

Zane’s blade, carrying the full weight of his essence, **descended like divine judgment.**

**A deafening silence.**

Then—

**"***I lose.***"**

Lucian’s voice cut through the air.

The crowd froze.

Zane’s sword had stopped **mere millimeters from Lucian’s throat.** Had the strike landed, it would have been over.

Slowly, Zane exhaled, letting his essence dissipate. A grin tugged at his lips. **"S***till sharp as ever, Lucian.***"**

Lucian smirked, shaking his head. **"***You always did fight recklessly. If that missed, you'd have been wide open.***"**

The fight had ended.

But the message was clear.

**Zane was still a monster.**

Zane, still catching his breath, shot my father an exasperated look. *"So are you finally going to tell me what this is all about now?"* he demanded, rolling his shoulders as he sheathed his blade.

My father, his grin laced with mischief, leaned forward slightly. *"I want you to train my son in the coming years. I want you to be his mentor—his teacher."*

Zane raised an eyebrow, clearly caught off guard. *"Me? Why? Don’t tell me you’re doubting your own ability. You’re more than capable of training him yourself, Lucian."*

My father let out a low chuckle. *"Oh, I know I am. But you? You’re better. You always have been. That spar just proved it yet again. I don’t want my son to settle for ‘good enough.’ I want him to learn from the very best. So, Zane, I’m asking you—take my child as your pupil."*

Zane exhaled sharply, crossing his arms as he considered the request. His expression was unreadable, his silence stretching just long enough for my father to notice. Then, with a sigh, Zane finally spoke. *"Let’s not get ahead of ourselves. The boy hasn’t even grown a tooth, much less manifested his Primordium yet. When he does, we’ll talk."*

My father smirked, confidence radiating from him. *"Fine. We’ll wait. But when the time comes, you’d better be ready—because my son is going to surprise you. He’ll be the greatest student you’ve ever had."*

Zane shook his head, a small laugh escaping him. The tension between them eased, replaced by the warmth of old camaraderie. With that, they continued their outing, reminiscing about past battles, shared victories, and the uncertain future that lay ahead.

The next day, as Zane was preparing to depart from my father’s domain and return to the capital, he caught sight of my sister in the training grounds, practicing her essence manipulation. She was focused, her small hands trembling slightly as she attempted to maintain the thin layer of energy coating her arms. Though unstable, the fact that she could manifest essence at such a young age was nothing short of astonishing.

Zane halted in his tracks, watching intently as she took a deep breath and tried again, this time holding the coating for a few seconds longer. A flicker of genuine surprise crossed his face before he turned to my father.

*"You know, Lucian, why didn’t you ask me to train her too?"* He gestured toward Celestia. *"She’s got potential. Even a low-level essence coating at her age is unheard of. With the right training, she could become something truly exceptional."*

Zane crossed his arms, considering for a moment before smirking. *"You know what? Forget waiting for you to ask—I’ll train her too."*

My father took a moment before responding, his gaze distant. *"I know, Zane. I know better than anyone how much potential she has—how incredible she could become. But I'm also afraid."* He exhaled, his expression softening. *"I don’t want her to be forced down a path of hardship. I want her to grow at her own pace, to enjoy her childhood without the weight of expectations crushing her. She’ll find her own way in time, and when she’s ready... she’ll decide for herself. I know it might seem contradictory—I asked you to train Summer, yet I hesitate when it comes to Celestia. But Summer... he'll have responsibilities in the future, a duty he cannot avoid. And Celestia... even though she, too, will have her own burdens, I want to give her something different—a peaceful life, at least for now."*

Zane exhaled in mild frustration but chose not to press the matter further. He knew my father well enough to understand that once his mind was set, there was little anyone could do to change it. With a final glance at Celestia—who remained focused on her practice, completely unaware of their conversation—he let out a small sigh.

*"You're too soft when it comes to her,"* Zane muttered, more to himself than to my father.

My father simply chuckled, shaking his head. *"Perhaps. But that's my choice to make."*

Zane gave a small smirk before turning on his heel. As he made his way toward the gates, the weight of their conversation lingered between them. My father walked beside him in silence, neither feeling the need to say much more. When they reached the castle gates, Zane mounted his horse, gripping the reins as he cast one last look at his old friend.

*"I'll hold you to your word, Lucian. When the time comes, don't let your fears hold her back."*

My father met his gaze, his expression unreadable. *"I won’t."*

With that, Zane gave a small nod and spurred his horse forward, the sound of hooves fading as he disappeared down the road. My father remained at the gates, watching until his friend was out of sight before turning back toward the castle, his thoughts lingering on the uncerta
