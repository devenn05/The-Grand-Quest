In the quiet, remote village of Dunford—home to barely thirty families and around 150 people—life moved at its own slow, familiar rhythm. The village was nestled in a valley surrounded by thick forests, where birds chirped and the sounds of daily life echoed gently across the land. By day, children played in the streets while farmers worked the fields, and by night, the town settled into a peaceful, predictable quiet. People knew each other here, and trust flowed through the village like the cool stream that ran by its edge. The smell of bread wafted from the bakery, the farmers’ markets were lively, and the local tavern, where stories and laughter spilled over every evening, was the heart of the village.

But this evening, something was different.

For Rustin, it was supposed to be the best day of his life. He had just passed his selection test to join Dunford’s military force, an honor that made his chest swell with pride. As he walked through the village paths, his face lit with a smile that could rival the sun setting behind the hills. He carried a warm, neatly packed meal from a tavern in the neighboring village—a small gesture meant to surprise his family with both dinner and the good news. He couldn’t wait to share the story with them, to finally give them something to be proud of.

The sun had almost dipped behind the hills, painting the sky in faint orange hues, casting long shadows across the cobblestone streets. It was the perfect evening for a homecoming, for an announcement that would change his life forever. The air felt crisp, and the wind carried the scent of damp earth from the fields, mingling with the fresh-baked bread he could already smell in his mind.

But as Rustin made his way down the familiar path to his house, a voice called out from the shadows. It was an unexpected interruption, and he paused, looking toward the sound. A tall figure stepped out from the darkness, one of the village’s wall guards, his spear glinting in the fading light.

"You there! Where are you going this late? Haven’t you heard? Lockdown’s been in place since last week!" The guard’s voice was deep, his posture rigid, and Rustin couldn’t help but notice the unease in his stance. The wall guard usually only patrolled the village perimeter.

Rustin furrowed his brow, a wave of confusion washing over him. "Yes, sir. I’m just heading home now. Today was my selection test for the Dunford military force—and I passed. I’d be honored to serve alongside capable warriors like yourself." He smiled, trying to keep his tone light and respectful, but something about the guard’s presence felt out of place. Why was he so deep inside the village? During a lockdown, internal patrolling was always left to the village guards.

The guard didn’t respond immediately, just stared at him for a moment before nodding curtly. "Don’t go wandering out at night again," he said in a clipped tone. "Stay inside, and keep your head on the table."

Rustin nodded and continued walking, but a lingering sense of unease clung to him like a heavy cloak. The guard’s behavior was odd—he wasn’t supposed to be here, and something about his eyes unsettled Rustin. But he pushed the feeling aside and continued toward his home, where he hoped to share his good news and a hearty meal with his family.

The streets were unusually quiet as he walked. Too quiet. Normally, there’d be children playing, the clink of metal from the blacksmith’s forge, or the sound of people talking in the marketplace. But now, the village seemed to hold its breath, the silence pressing against him like a tangible weight. Rustin couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong.

Arriving at his small home, he washed his hands at the tap outside as he always did before entering. The comforting rhythm of his routine did little to calm his nerves. He stepped inside, meal box in hand, expecting to hear his mother bustling in the kitchen or his father’s deep voice calling out from the other room. But what he found instead made his blood run cold.

Three heads.

Not just any heads—his mother’s, his father’s, and his little sister’s.

Lined up neatly on the table like they were part of some sick dinner setting. Their eyes were half-open, their lips twisted in silent screams that had never left their faces. They looked as if they had been mid-sentence when it happened—still and lifeless, staring at nothing and everything.

Rustin froze. He couldn’t breathe. His mind screamed in denial, but no sound came from his lips. His stomach twisted in a painful knot, and the meal box he had been carrying slipped from his fingers. The sharp thud of it hitting the floor seemed far too loud in the silence of the house. His eyes remained locked on the grotesque scene before him, his body frozen, refusing to acknowledge what his mind was trying to comprehend. His mother’s, father’s, and little sister’s heads sat on the table, their bodies nowhere to be found. Their faces, twisted in silent horror, haunted him.

No. No. No, this couldn’t be real. He tried to force the image away, but it was there—impossible, undeniable. His family. Gone. Taken.

The panic hit him like a flood. A wave of terror that pulled him under, drowning him in a sea of confusion and despair. His knees buckled beneath him, but he didn’t collapse. Instead, he sprang to his feet, turning sharply toward the door. He had to leave, had to get out. Maybe it wasn’t real. Maybe he’d find someone who could explain it all. His mind raced for some kind of explanation, some form of hope.

But when he stepped outside, it was the same nightmare. The village had turned into a mausoleum, a hollow graveyard where life no longer existed. As he ran down the path, his heart pounding, his breath short, he saw it again—another house, another family torn apart. The same horrific arrangement of heads. Neatly placed. Eyes staring, unblinking, lifeless.

He couldn’t breathe. He couldn’t think. His legs turned to lead as he stumbled forward, dragging himself from one door to the next, hoping against all odds that this was just a terrible mistake. But it wasn’t. His neighbor’s house, the baker’s house, even the old couple who lived by the river—all the same. Heads, lined up like they were part of some perverse ritual. Their lifeless eyes staring into nothingness. No blood, no bodies. Just heads.

Desperation clawed at Rustin’s chest, but he couldn’t stop himself. He needed to find someone, anyone. Someone who could tell him what had happened, who could make sense of this madness. His thoughts were a blur as he ran, his mind grasping at the fragments of reality that still clung to him.

The village guardhouse. Maybe the guards had information. Maybe they were safe. Maybe I could report all of this to them. 

His legs carried him faster now, every step bringing him closer to the place that should have offered him some semblance of safety. But when he reached it, what he saw stopped him in his tracks.

Inside, five severed heads—familiar faces—were mounted on a five different spear, their lifeless eyes staring blankly ahead. The bodies were gone, the place reeking of death. The spears stood tall, a grotesque display of victory for whoever had done this. It didn’t make sense. The guards were supposed to protect the village, not become part of this horrific scene. He staggered backward, shaking uncontrollably. His hands trembled as he gripped the wall for support. There was no one left.

No one.

The village, once so full of life, now lay in ruins. Rustin couldn’t breathe, couldn’t think straight. His heart felt as though it was being crushed beneath the weight of the truth. The silence that had once comforted him now smothered him, thick and suffocating. How had this happened? Why? Who could have done such a thing?

The last shred of hope that had kept him going shattered, and his legs moved on their own. He couldn’t stop. He didn’t know why he was going back to his home, but he couldn’t seem to turn away from it. He already knew there was no escape from the nightmare that had become his reality.

As he approached the house, his body shook uncontrollably, a cold sweat breaking out across his skin. He had to prepare himself, but no amount of mental preparation could have made him ready for what awaited him inside.

The door creaked open with an unsettling groan, and he expected to only saw his families heads on the table but what he saw along with that was terrifying.

A figure. A vampire. Broad-shouldered, with long black hair and dead, black eyes. His presence cold and suffocating.

It sat calmly at the table, its sharp fangs glistening in the dim light of the room. The vampire was feasting, but not on the heads—no. It was tearing into the meal Rustin had brought home earlier, savoring each bite with a twisted pleasure. Blood dripped down the creature’s chin, soaking into its clothes, and the glint in its eyes sent a chill racing down Rustin’s spine. The vampire paused, mid-bite, and looked up at him. Their eyes met.

A smile spread across the vampire’s face. It was cold. Hungry. And then, the figure spoke, its voice a smooth, silky rasp that seemed to crawl under Rustin’s skin.

“You brought food. How kind.”

Rustin’s heart lurched. He couldn’t comprehend it. The vampire, sitting there, so nonchalant as if it had no care in the world. As if the horrors it had unleashed were nothing more than a game.

Everything in him screamed to run, to escape, but his feet were rooted to the floor. He could barely think. The rage that had been boiling inside him since he found his family’s remains surged to the surface. His hands shook, and fire crackled at his fingertips. The Essence he had learned to control, the power he had worked so hard to develop, surged within him like a storm.

He didn’t hesitate. He couldn’t. He thrust his hands forward, fire leaping from his palms, racing toward the vampire. But before the spell could even leave his fingertips, the room shimmered. The vampire raised a hand, and a slash of Essence cut through the air like a whip, striking Rustin with a brutal force that snapped his body backward.

Rustin gasped, the air knocked from his lungs as his body was thrown against the wall. His chest ached, but he barely had time to react before the ground beneath him shimmered. A tear in reality—a warp in space itself—opened up beneath him, and before he could grasp what was happening, the world turned to chaos. The floor vanished, and his body was pulled through the void, everything below his neck torn away in an instant.

Rustin’s head remained, spinning in the air, his body nowhere to be seen. The vampire stood from the table, casually placing his severed head next to his family’s, as though it were a final piece in a gruesome puzzle. The cold smile never left his face.

And just like that, Rustin was gone.

The vampire lingered for a moment, savoring the meal in eerie silence, then stood and stretched. He didn’t look back. His job was done. Without a word, he turned and left the house, disappearing into the night, as if he had never been there at all.
