Chapter 3: The Return

**BOOM.**

The world stopped. Everything frozen mid-motion. Draven, the cave, even time itself... paused.

Only I could move, only I was breathing.

And I had no idea *why.*

And then— **BOOM.**

Time snapped back. The air rushed back into my lungs, and the world came alive again. Water splattered to the ground. The torches flickered. Draven’s arm jerked forward, his cocky expression still in place like he hadn’t just been frozen in time.

But me? I was standing there one my single leg, completely dazed, my heart racing, trying to make sense of what the hell just happened. Did—did I just freeze time? Is that even possible?

I felt it. I *knew* something had changed. But I couldn’t put it into words. It was like my body had done something it shouldn’t be able to do. Something no one should be able to do. *But I had.*

I didn’t know why or how. But it happened.

And whatever it was? It felt *big*. Too big for me to ignore. I had no clue what it meant, but I knew, in the back of my mind, it was gonna change everything. Change me.

I shook myself out of it. Had to. No time to think. Because Draven, clueless as ever, didn’t even realize what just happened. He was still in full mock mode, trying to push my buttons like it was another damn game.

But then—he felt it. Just a tiny, imperceptible shift in his demeanor. He felt *something*. His confidence was a little shaken, just for a second. His eyes narrowed.

Then, without warning, he went all in. No more playtime. No more fakes. His aura flared up in his arm—this time, the strike was real. No games.

“*Well, I’m done with you now,*” Draven sneered, his voice dripping with malice. He raised his hand, fingers curling like claws, the air around him crackling with lethal intent.

I wasn’t ready. I wasn’t thinking.

My brain was still whirling with what had just happened. But then, instinct kicked in. Pure, raw survival.

I had no time. I didn’t even stop to think.

**SNAP.**

**BOOM.**

Time froze again.

Draven’s attack froze midair—an Essence slash, sharp and glowing, suspended just inches from my face. It hung there, unnaturally still, like the world had skipped a beat. His grin hadn’t faded, lips curled in that same smug confidence. His eyes were wide, full of pride—

*This is my chance.*

I didn’t waste a second. My body moved before my brain could catch up. I dove to the side, barely missing the slash by inches. Time snapped back into place. 

**BOOM**

 …..and the world resumed like nothing happened. But Draven? He stepped forward like he’d won, sure that I was just another casualty, another easy kill.

But I wasn’t where he thought I’d be.

***Impossible**.*

Eyes narrowing, confused. He took a step back, his brow furrowing in disbelief. His eyes flicked to the space where I *should* have been, and for the first time, I saw something on his face—*doubt*.

He couldn’t wrap his head around it. No way in hell could someone like me have dodged that attack. There was no way I was fast enough, not with the difference between his speed and mine. But here I was. Alive. Standing.

And Draven? He couldn’t figure it out. His confidence was cracked, and for a brief moment, he was left with nothing but questions.

And I—*I*—wasn’t done yet.

Annoyance flashed across Draven’s face, his lips curling into a sneer. It shifted into frustration, his sharp eyes narrowing. The confusion only deepened. He couldn’t make sense of what had just happened.

I, on the other hand, was completely lost. My mind was a storm of chaos, a whirlwind of panic, confusion, and adrenaline. What the hell did I just do? I didn’t have the time—or clarity—to make sense of it, but one thing was painfully clear: this was something big. Something far beyond anything I’d ever trained for.

*Most likely… a second Primordium.* And not just any kind—*Reality Influence.* But if that’s true… then what the hell was that golden light I saw just before it all happened? That flash—*that* moment—wasn’t just some random thought. It felt like something deep inside me had cracked open. Like this power didn’t come from me, but *through* me.

The thought alone made my skin crawl. I couldn’t even process it. My thoughts were flashing like broken lightning, scattered and frantic, each one louder than the last. Nothing made sense. And yet… somehow, deep down, I knew everything had just changed.

Now came the real problem—*what the hell was I supposed to do with this power?* And how was I going to scale the mountain that stood ahead of me? Because if I couldn’t figure out how to kill—or at the very least, incapacitate—Draven **right now**, then none of this would matter.

I’d be dead.

I wasn’t fooling myself. I couldn’t keep dodging his attacks forever. Wounding him wasn’t going to cut it. Not with someone like Draven. He’d figure it out, adapt, and come back stronger. If I didn’t end this now, I wouldn’t get another chance.

I swallowed hard. My whole body screamed for rest, but the fight was still on. My only option? To finish it. *Now.*

The silence between us was suffocating, thick with tension. Time seemed to stretch out like a rubber band pulled too far, waiting to snap.

Finally, Draven spoke. His voice was cold, venom lacing each word.

“Brat, what the hell did you just do? And how?”

I didn’t flinch, didn’t even blink. My expression was flat, blank. As if this was just another bad day. “What are you talking about?”

His eyes darkened, narrowing with that deadly focus. “Don’t play dumb. You *dodged* my attack. If you had this ability, why didn’t you avoid my last two hits? Tell me the truth, or I’ll make sure your death is the most agonizing thing you could ever imagine.”

I knew Draven. He didn’t want answers. He wanted to *break me*. But I couldn’t afford to mess this up. A reckless answer would only make him angry—*angrier*. The last thing I needed was to set him off more.

I paused. Gritting my teeth, I gave him just enough to keep him from going ballistic. “I saw it coming.”

It wasn’t a lie. I *had* seen it coming. Just not in the way Draven would ever understand.

Draven clicked his tongue in frustration, the sound echoing through the cave. Without another word, he began to walk toward me, his steps heavy, deliberate. Each one felt like a hammer against my chest.

I had **seconds** to think. As Draven closed the distance between us, my mind raced—*spinning, scrambling*. I couldn’t just stall him. Couldn’t just land a hit. He had to be ended. For good.

And the worst part? I hadn’t even figured out how to use this new phenomenon to my advantage.

A simple punch wouldn’t cut it. Hell, even driving a blade through his heart wouldn’t be enough—*vampires aren’t human.* They don’t just keel over from a fatal wound. I knew he wouldn’t die that easily.

I remembered hearing stories about vampires and how sunlight was their true weakness, but in this cave, surrounded by pitch-black darkness? Sunlight wasn’t going to help me here.

A wooden stake through the heart could paralyze him—maybe even kill him, if I got lucky. Wounds from wood were dangerous for vampires, sometimes even fatal. But I sure as hell wasn’t pulling one out of thin air.

*If only I were a Manifestation user…* 

The only shot I had was to immobilize him—or hit him hard enough to shatter his focus, to drive him so far into chaos he couldn’t stay sane long enough to stop me from escaping this cave.

Then, it hit me.

*Decapitation.*

It wouldn’t kill Draven outright, but without his head? His body would stop functioning. He’d be useless. At least for a while. And that would give me enough time to figure out my next move.

Could I pull it off, though?

I had no sword. No weapons. My aura was nearly depleted. Draven’s skin? Tougher than steel. A clean cut through his neck? *Impossible*.

Then, a flash of memory hit me.

Zane’s face appeared in my mind, clear as day.

**A lesson with Zane, A distant Memory.**

---

“You think this half-hearted effort will take you anywhere?” Zane’s voice cut through my thoughts like a knife.
A much younger me sat there on the training grounds, drenched in sweat, exhausted. I was struggling—so hard—trying and failing to pull my aura into my arms. Something so basic for an Essence Manipulator. It was supposed to be simple, but in that moment? It felt impossible.
"I know you’re struggling," Zane’s voice softened for a moment, almost like he was trying to calm me down. "You’re overthinking it. *You’re trying to force something that won’t come naturally.*"
His words hit me like a hammer. He was right. I was overthinking it. My mind raced a thousand miles per minute, trying to figure out the “right” way to make it happen, trying to live up to something I couldn’t even grasp yet.
"*You’re constantly being compared to your sister. You feel like you have to meet everyone’s expectations. But that pressure? That doubt? It’s all meaningless—until you’re in a position where you truly need to make it happen.*"
"*The moment you reach that breaking point, it will either consume you... or you’ll break past your limits.*"

---

Draven was nearly on me. The ground shook with his heavy steps. I could feel the heat of his aura—his presence pressing down on me like an iron weight.

*I clenched my fists. This was it**.** My breaking point. My last shot.*

My aura felt like a flicker of a flame in my chest, too weak to do anything. Could I gather it in time? **Impossible.**

*But I had to.* I didn’t have a choice.

“D-Don’t come any closer! Stay away!” I stammered, forcing the words out through gritted teeth. I had to pretend, to feign fear—make Draven think he had the upper hand.

I could feel the sneer in his gaze. The arrogance. He wasn’t fooled. He saw right through it, taking my words lightly as he moved closer, his guard half-lowered, convinced of his superiority.

*Pathetic.*

His confidence bled through the air. He thought I was nothing. And that’s what would kill him.

Chuckling, Draven gathered his own aura, the energy humming with dangerous intensity. He was a second away from decapitating me. I could feel it, the weight of the blade in his hand, ready to bring it down on my neck.

And then—just as Draven’s attack was within inches of me—

**SNAP.**

**BOOM.**

The world twisted. The last thing Draven saw was the snap of my fingers, and in that single instant, his entire world flipped upside down.

Confusion tore through him. For a split second, he was completely disoriented—lost in the chaos. One moment he was lunging forward, the next, he was suspended midair… staring at the cave ceiling upside down.

He felt… *distant*. Like his body wasn’t even his own.

Then he felt it—a sudden tug, a tightness around his hair.

His gaze darted up, and when his eyes met mine, his mouth opened, but no sound came out. The world slowed. Time seemed to stretch.

**I was holding his head by the hair.**

I wasn’t sure if it was blood, sweat, or both dripping down my face, but I didn’t care. All I could focus on was his lifeless eyes staring back at me. I grinned, slow and cold. The blood on my lips didn’t seem so terrible now.

*"It wasn’t very wise of you to underestimate this ‘brat,’ was it?*" I whispered, my voice a chill that cut through the dark cave.

“*You were going to feast on me, right?*” I tilted his head, letting my words hang between us like the calm before a storm. "*Well, let's see how you do that now."*

Without hesitation, I drove my fingers **straight into his eyes**, feeling the soft, sickening pop as his vision was torn away from him.

Draven screamed—his voice warping with an inhuman pitch that rattled my bones.

Next, I tore off his ears—shredding his ability to hear anything, turning his desperate cries into meaningless wails.

Draven wailed in a panic, helpless.

With a sick, twisted smirk, I reached for his nose—ripped it off, leaving him without any sense of smell.

The once-mighty vampire was now reduced to **nothing but a blind, deaf, disfigured head.**

### **The Exit**

Now that Draven was decapitated—severed from his senses, blind and deaf—I knew I had only a *small* window to act.

I had two choices.

One: destroy his entire body. Head and all. But that carried too much risk. His main body was still moving, twitching violently, and I didn’t have the strength to face it head-on again. If I failed, if I even *hesitated*, it could’ve cost me my life.

So I chose the second option.

I’d find the exit. I’d carry his cursed head out of this forsaken place and expose it to the one thing that could kill him for good—sunlight**.**

I kept walking, dragging my battered leg down the same path I had been on since the start. My vision blurred. My lungs burned. But I didn’t stop.

Behind me, Draven was screaming. Rambling in agony.

*“Brat! What have you done to me?!”*

*“RETURN ME TO MY BODY, YOU WORTHLESS TRASH! DO YOU THINK YOU’VE WON?!”*

I ignored every word. Let him scream. Let him *feel* powerless.

Still, one thought clawed at my mind—one that terrified me to my core.

*What if he used a portal to summon his head back to his body?*

*What if he pulled me along with it?*

But I didn’t have time to weigh the odds. It was a gamble—but one I had to take. It was still safer than confronting his body in its berserk state.

So I ran. Limped. Stumbled. Anything to keep moving forward.

And then—I saw it.

A distant glow. Faint at first, like a star on the horizon. But it grew brighter with every agonizing step.

*The exit.*

For a heartbeat, I froze.

A surge of emotion rose in my chest—relief, disbelief, hope. I had *truly* thought I was going to die down here. That this cave would be my grave. But here I was. Bruised, bleeding, broken—yet alive. Holding the decapitated head of a monster who had nearly ended me.

I forced my legs to move faster. My heart pounded. My hands trembled as I clutched Draven’s skull. I could almost taste the air outside, feel the sun’s warmth reach for me.

And then—

I stepped out.

Light washed over me like a tidal wave—bright, golden, *alive.*

Draven's head began to scream.

A shriek tore from his mouth, high-pitched and feral, as smoke started to curl from his flesh.

His skin bubbled. Cracked. Flaked.

“NO—NOOOO! WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!”

The sun scorched him like fire from the heavens. His cries became incoherent, nothing more than gurgled wails of pain. Then—

Ash.

His flesh disintegrated. His bones blackened. And all that remained was a brittle, lifeless skull, crumbling in my grip.

I stared at it.

A wave of exhaustion hit me like a tidal wave.

My knees buckled. My vision dimmed. The last thing I felt was the warm sun on my face—before the world turned black.

**I passed out.**

**Still holding Draven’s skull in my hand.**
