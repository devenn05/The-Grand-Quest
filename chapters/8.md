Chapter 8: Garden of Roses

As usual Chris practically dragged us outside to play volleyball, and before I knew it, we were in the garden—the quieter, more secluded part of the castle grounds. The air was crisp, carrying the familiar scent of fresh grass and rose, three guards were in garden’s vicinity…..but something else too lingered. Something off.

Something was watching us.

I felt it. That eerie weight of unseen eyes pressing down. But then Chris was already pulling me into the game, so I brushed it off. Maybe I was imagining things.

We played. Chris, as hyper as ever, was practically bouncing off the walls, and even Reus—usually the serious one—was getting competative. And me? I was there. Forced into it. No escape. Just when I was about to convince myself to enjoy it, the ball bounced toward me—

And that’s when the chill hit me.

It shot down my spine, freezing me mid-movement. My instincts screamed at me to turn. So I did—just the slightest glance over my shoulder.

And for a split second, I *saw* it. A shadow. Lurking. Watching.

And then—gone.

Vanished, like it had never been there. My gut twisted. First that feeling of being watched, and now this? 

But who would be stupid enough to sneak into the Williams estate? No one with a functioning brain, that’s for sure. If they had a death wish, then… well, that was their problem.

So, I ignored it. Batted an eye again. And just when I as about to move on, the air shifted.

This time, it wasn’t a feeling.

It was real.

One of the guards—gone.

No sound. 

No struggle. 

Just… *gone*.

A sickening silence settled over the garden. The other two guards stiffened, their gazes sharp as they scanned the area, muscles tense, ready for a fight.

Reus and I noticed immediately.

Chris, of course, was still grinning, completely oblivious. His ability to sense danger was next to zero.

A sinking weight formed in my stomach. The feeling from earlier? It hadn’t been my imagination. Something *was* here. And now, something *was* happening.

I met Reus’s eyes. We didn’t need words. Without hesitation, we split up, scanning different sections of the garden.

Looking back, maybe we should’ve just run.

Because the moment we started searching, we had already lost.

We combed through the area for nearly five minutes, the garden unnervingly silent. The two remaining guards remained tense, their eyes flicking nervously from side to side. None of us had any idea what had just happened, and the uncertainty hung heavy in the air. The guards approached Chris and motioned for him to head back into the castle with us. As he started walking toward me to signal my turn, it hit.

A presence.

*Dark*. *Overwhelming.*

It crashed into my mind like a tidal wave, sinking its claws deep into my consciousness.

I *froze*.

This was different. This wasn’t just a bad feeling. It was something far, *far* worse.

My body locked up. I couldn’t move.

And then—

I *saw* it.

A hand.

Pale. Grotesque. Emerging from the empty space right in front of me.

Just a hand.

And yet, the sheer *wrongness* of it sent terror surging through my entire being.

I tried to move. I *wanted* to move.

But before I could—

It *grabbed* my throat.

Cold. Like death itself.

I gasped, instinctively trying to coat my body in aura—*nothing*. My essence wouldn’t respond. My body refused to listen.

The grip tightened.

It was *pulling* me in.

Dragging me toward that warped space—toward the unknown.

Chris had reached me just in time to see it.

His mouth opened—he wanted to scream. He wanted to move.

But terror held him in place.

And just like that—

I was gone.

The only thing left in that garden was a single black rose, resting on the ground.
