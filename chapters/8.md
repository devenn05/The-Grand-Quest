Mossback. A giant beast, brown fur draping off its hulking body like shaggy vines, muscles rippling beneath the weight of its steps. Its face—bear-like, but older, wiser. An Essence-gleaming creature, ancient and territorial. Like a forest guardian—and right now, I’ve just trespassed.

I should’ve figured this out sooner. A forest this dense and quiet, no animals in sight? That only means one thing—someone owns this place.

And now it's here.

Without wasting any second, I started running while making sure I keep my bearings so I don’t get lost. Fighting it? Not a chance. Mossbacks aren’t just wild animals—they’re monsters in all but form. Their Essence pool? Easily rivals a Full Stage Ascendant Wielder. I’m not suicidal. 

What caught me off guard was its speed.

It’s fast—way faster than anything that big should be. If I keep running like this, I’m not confident that it’ll not catch me before I end up back at the mountain. If I do reach, climbing the mountain could slow it down, sure—it won’t be able to follow me up the sheer slope—but it might stalk the area for days. I won’t shake it off that easy.

Then a spark hits me. A stupid, desperate idea.

The trees.

I dart to the closest one and start climbing like my life depends on it—because it does. The trees here are close together, their branches tangled like nature’s own escape route.

I reach a decent height, then leap. One tree to the next. Then another. Then another.

And I started heading in the same direction as before—towards the coastal mountain. It’s exhausting. I keep channeling Essence into my palms—just enough to cling tighter, grip firmer. Each branch I grab feels slick with sweat, bark rough against my skin. I don’t stop. Can’t stop. My arms burn, and every leap chips away at my Essence reserves. But at least I’m not heading backward. And the Mossback’s still down there, roaring and thundering after me, crashing through underbrush like a force of nature.

Then it happens.

The ground shakes.

My next jump misses.

I catch a branch—barely—fingers clawing to hold on. My body swings, off-balance, breath caught in my throat. I glance down.

And what I see stops my heart cold.

The Mossback slams into the tree’s base with a roar, and the whole damn thing topples like a tower of sticks.

I’m barely catching my breath when—crack—another swipe. This time, it's the tree that I’m on.

Wood splitting. Bark peeling. The trunk starts to tip.

I’ve got seconds.

I snap my fingers.

Flash.

I'm on the next tree.

My first time using the Spatial Realm in open daylight. Yeah—I’ve been calling it that. Fancy shit.

But now I see it. Feel it. A five to six meter radius, spherical space under my control. The moment I activate it, that entire chunk of reality bends to me.

The upper half of the falling tree? Frozen. Suspended in midair, caught inside my Sphere. The trunk’s base was already tipping from the Mossback’s hit, but because part of it entered my Realm—it just stopped. If I had to hold a tree that size with Essence alone, no chance. Even if I dumped my whole pool into it, it’d never be enough. But this—this isn’t about force. It’s about control.

No time to think.

I leap again, onto the next tree.

The Mossback stares up, visibly confused—but not for long. It doesn’t waste time. Starts charging through the forest again, slashing, smashing, tearing down trees like they're made of paper.

Each time, I dodge by a hair.

Then—he stops.

I thought mid-hop, hopeful for half a second that he’s giving up.

Then the tree I’m about to land on starts to fall.

Shit.

Smart bastard. He anticipated my jump—punched that tree just early enough for it to collapse as I was mid-air. Timed it to screw my balance.

No time to think, no room for the Realm.

I take the fall.

Hit the trunk. Roll. Bend with it. My legs absorb the shock as I land hard, bracing, skidding with the motion until I hit ground.

No broken bones. No gashes. Just some scratches.

Lucky.

But not for long.

Because unless I find a way to kill or cripple this thing… I’m not making it out.

Mentally bracing myself, I check my footing and scan the area. I need a plan—and fast. The coastal mountains are maybe a kilometer out. If I sprint without interruptions, I could reach them in six minutes. Ten, tops, if the terrain gets rough.

But in a fair fight? I’ve got no chance. Mossbacks aren't just tanks—they're predators with instincts sharp enough to learn mid-battle. And now, it’s seen my Spatial Realm. It might not be as smart as us, but it's smart enough.

I grabbed a thick branch lying nearby. Not ideal, but it’s something.

Then, face him.

To my surprise, the Mossback doesn’t charge right away. He just stands there, tense, eyes tracking me. Still confused, maybe. Still trying to figure out what the hell I did.

Without wasting a second I dash forward, using my speed as my edge—but the illusion shatters instantly. Its paw moves before I even register it. A blur. A whip. I barely see the strike until it's already an inch from my ribs.

Boom.

I go flying. Slam into a tree so hard the breath gets knocked clean out of me. Pain screams down my spine. Everything hurts.

Trying to move but,

Nothing.

Then I force it. Elbow digs in. Knees push. I moved.

But before I can fully rise—the Mossback is already on me.

Shit—!

No choice.

I snap my fingers.

Flash.

I dodge into the Realm mid-motion, phasing just as its punch crashes down where my head was a second ago. I land on my feet a few inches away, gasping.

The tree behind me explodes from the force of its missed punch.

The Mossback whips around, blinking. Sees me. Really sees me. Confusion fades. Now he’s just angry.

I don’t have long. That dodge drained me. Essence pool’s barely at around less than half, about forty percent, maybe less. One more use—one final use—before I’m dry.

*Focus Summer!*

This ends now.

I charged.

Mossback charged as well.

We meet in the middle.

Two meters out—I snap my fingers again.

Everything freezes.

I’m moving inside the stillness. Both palms blaze with Essence. I drive my hands forward, sharp and precise—not toward his throat, not his chest—his eyes. I don’t think I could’ve pierce that thick hide, but I can blind him.

My fingers made contact. My essence coated fingers, straight into his Eyes.

Time snaps back.

The Mossback screams. The sound rips through the forest like thunder—wild, guttural, agonized. He reels, slapping his claws over his face, blood pouring through them like red-hot streams.

Without wasting even a second, I  started runnning.

My Essence pool is almost gone. Doesn’t matter. My legs are moving faster than they ever have—pure adrenaline, pure survival. No time to think, no energy left to waste.

Just me, the road ahead—and a furious roar fading behind me.

In about 5 minutes I reached at the base of the mountains.

Without wasting any time, I start climbing.

The terrain’s pretty much the same as the last mountain I scaled, though this one's definitely smaller. 

First a vampire, and now a freaking Mossback. Yeah, smooth sailing? Not in my goddamn story. But even so—I’ve still got a chance. More than a chance, actually. I’ve got a freaking trump card. And if I play it right… I could become unstoppable.

In about half an hour, I manage to cover almost fifty percent of the climb. But now that the adrenaline’s wearing off, the pain hits me like a delayed curse. My back’s a mess from that crash into the tree. Nothing feels broken, but it's definitely not just a scratch I can shrug off. Climbing is getting harder. Every movement pulls at the ache.

Still, I will push through. I have to. Just till I reach the top.

And so—I kept climbing….

*“Hey Alfred, I made a new friend today. A friendly Mossback. We even had a light sparring match.”*

*“Oh, that’s wonderful, Master. I’m glad to hear you’re enjoying your trip to the Coastals.”*

*“Yeah, I’m having a blast. Couldn’t have asked for more!”*

Man… I miss Alfred.

Anyway—I’m nearly at the top now.

The satisfaction, the sense of achievement I feel as I take those last steps—it’s unreal. All that struggle, and I’m finally standing here. Now, if only I could find something to eat. Yeah, I’m sick of apples, but honestly? Right now even those would taste like sweet, honey-roasted chicken.

And gods—I haven’t had a single drop of water.

My Essence kept me going this far, but if someone handed me a cold bottle of water right now, I’d probably cry on the spot.

By the look of the sun, I’ve still got a few hours before sunset. Last few Steps and then,

Then—I see it.

A vast, endless stretch of blue.

The ocean.

Waves shimmer under the afternoon light, rolling slow and steady like breathing. The sun glints across the surface, scattering gold across the water. The sea wind hits me—salted, wild, and cold—and it feels like it cuts through every layer of grime and exhaustion on my body. The beach below curves out into the distance, pale and untouched, the sand glowing under the sun like powdered pearl.

And in that moment, I forget the pain. The fights. The blood. The hunger.

Because this… this is  fucking beautiful.

But just as quickly, reality taps me on the shoulder.

This ocean? It’s deadly too. I’ve heard the stories. Shipwrecks. Creatures beneath the surface. The moods of the tides shifting like a living thing. And worse—there’s a real chance I could run into an Aquari.

Beautiful or not, I need to be careful.

Still… for now, I just take a moment to breathe it in.

---

Two hours had passed since I got up here.

And a bummer—no apples for me.

Well, I was prepared for it, to be honest. Lucky I even got those big-ass apples in the first place. No food today, I guess. Gotta start getting used to this, because I really have no idea when I’ll even see Lunaris again, much less Riverton.

Still, I hope I’ll manage to at least eat something, maybe drink here and there. I don’t like this empty feeling.

Yeah, and that thought about immediately descending and exploring? Straight to the bin. My back made sure I understood just how bad of an idea that was the moment I even touched the ground. I needed that rest—that little nap.

But staying here wasn’t gonna do me any good either. There’s still a solid hour before the sun fully sets. Might as well start heading in the direction I’ll be travelling tomorrow. No point wasting daylight.

So… which direction?

Whichever way I go, I’ll still be kilometers away from Lunaris. That place sits in the center of Avalon. If I follow the coast southwest or straight south, I might hit a port—there’s plenty scattered along that side, though they don’t belong to any human nations.

But if I gamble and head north or northwest, I’ll probably cross into human territory. Problem is, it could be days before I even see a port—dense northern forests make those regions a nightmare for shipbuilding and trade.

> *One of the ways to navigate is through the sun. It rises in the east, sets in the west.*
> 

With a serious breath, I chose south.

Even if it didn’t take me near a human nation, I’d prioritize finding a port. Someone there might help me out—or at least point me in the right direction back to Lunaris. It’s better than risking my life navigation through the northern regions.

I started walking.

 The sun slowly dipped, golden hues bleeding across the surface of the ocean. It was beautiful. Painfully beautiful.

I really wish I’d come here with Cel.

Well... that’s not gonna happen.

Half an hour passed—surprisingly, I covered almost two, maybe two-and-a-half kilometers.

The sun was fully gone now, and the moon had taken its place—only a crescent, like a sharp cut in the sky. And tonight, the sky was clear. Stars peeked through one by one, each shimmer a quiet comfort in the silence.

Time to find a place to rest.

A decent-sized tree with thick cover from above and a good shield on one side—I decide this is as good a place as any to crash for the night.

My Essence pool’s definitely grown a bit since I got snatched from the castle. If the limit was around 100 before, now it’s probably sitting somewhere at 105, maybe 110. That’s a wild jump. I’m guessing it’s because I nearly drained myself twice —first in the cave, then the fight with Mossback. Before this, the only time I’d faced anything truly life-threatening was when Alfred came at me with his Essence-coated sword. But today? Today was a whole new genre of danger.

I need to get stronger. I’m no better than your average teen when it comes to Essence control. Honestly? Maybe even weaker. Swordplay’s my thing, yeah, but Essence wielding? That’s where I lag. Might as well start training as I figure out how to get back. After what today threw at me, I can’t even begin to guess what tomorrow or next week might look like. Better to start preparing.

*“Alfred, teach me how to improve the flow of Essence through my arm so I can slash a rock clean in half.”*

*“Certainly, Master. But for that, you’ll have to die and reincarnate with a new body—perhaps one more like Miss Celestia’s. Still, if you’re serious about learning the proper way, start by holding the Essence in your arm longer. That’s the first step to strengthening your hardening technique. Who knows—maybe someday you’ll cut that rock.”*

*“Okay, Alfred. Thanks for the helpful advice. Oh and one more thing,  I haven’t eaten anything today. But who needs food when you’ve got Essence, right? Let’s go—Essence to the hands!”*

...And so I train while rambling like a lunatic, swinging my arms and talking to no one in the middle of nowhere.

For two hours I kept at it, focusing on holding the Essence in my arms for as long as possible. It drained me—half of my pool was gone during the process. 

Eventually, I slept due to exhaustion.
