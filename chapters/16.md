As we reach the mouth of the estuary, the landscape shifts. The coastal mountain range we’ve been following abruptly ends here, as if sliced clean by some ancient force, making way for a wide river that barrels into the ocean. For nearly two months, we’ve trudged along the same stretch—five hundred kilometers of repetitive terrain: endless shoreline, scattered coastal forest, and those looming mountains always on our right. Now, for the first time in weeks, the scenery changes. And it’s not subtle.

Jagged islands rise from the estuary like broken teeth, scattered across the merging waters. The river cutting through them is monstrous—wide, fast, and loud, a force of nature crashing into the sea like it’s trying to carve its own continent. The estuary itself is chaotic, dotted with swirling currents and mist rising where salt and freshwater wrestle. It feels alive, almost breathing.

Ronan studies the river, then speaks.

“We’ll follow this stream into Silverlake Forest from here.”

We’re going inside the forest? Great. That means the peaceful part of our journey is over. We hardly faced any creatures on this coastline—just birds, wind, and salt. If we had gone into the ocean itself, that would be another conversation entirely. The things out there? Far worse than whatever’s lurking inside a forest. But yeah, the coastline? It was the safest place we could’ve been.

“You said a week more, right?” Aurora asks, brushing her hair back, eyes still on the darkening tree line ahead.

“If all goes well, yeah. Silverlake City is less than a hundred kilometers from here. But distance isn’t the issue. The real problem is what we’ll face in this forest.” Ronan’s voice carries a weight I don’t miss. “No more training from here on out. The creatures we encounter will do that for us. That’s one of the reasons I pushed Summer to train so hard. Not because I couldn’t handle things myself—but because if luck turns sour and we run into something nasty, I need a team, not deadweight.”

He glances at me.

“Now, you’re more than capable of handling howlers, razerwings, and shadow panthers. But if you see a Mossback—don’t try to fight it alone. Hell, don’t even think about splitting up. Stick close. We take those down together, or not at all.”

I know, I know—Mossbacks are a no-no, Ronan, I grumble internally.

We step into the forest, hugging the river’s edge. The terrain changes fast. The canopy tightens overhead, cutting off direct light, and the salt-heavy breeze gets swallowed by humid air. The forest is thick—twisting vines, root-webbed ground, trees with bark so dark it looks scorched.

“Be sharp,” Ronan warns. “Following the river will keep us from getting lost, but don’t get comfortable. As we move upstream, the mix of salt and freshwater attracts more creatures—territorial ones. We’re entering their feeding ground.”

I expected that. Still, it’s weird seeing Skye walking calmly beside me. Usually I have to carry her like some spoiled brat, but not today. She’s calm.

Deeper into the woods, the world muffles. The ocean’s roar fades. Wind dies. All that remains is the rush of the river and the pulse of the forest around us.

The forest isn’t just trees. It’s alive in a way that unsettling. Branches seem to move when you’re not looking. There’s an earthy scent—wet moss, decaying leaves, iron-rich soil—and it clings to your lungs like it’s trying to root inside. Bioluminescent fungi pulse in shaded corners, glowing faint blue and green. Every few meters, unfamiliar plants twist upward from the undergrowth, some of them bearing fruit that looks edible—until you get close and realize they’re not fruit, but fleshy pods that quiver at your presence. It’s a completely different forest from my last exploration two months ago.

The canopy groans as if alive, leaves fluttering even when there’s no wind. I swear I see eyes blink from tree bark—slits of watching awareness—then vanish into still wood. To our left, the Silverlake River churns with a quiet menace. Its waters aren’t just fast—they pulse, shifting colors beneath the surface like something alive swims just out of sight. The current sings in a language I don’t understand, whispering too many voices at once. Banks are jagged, chewed away by years of force, and slick stones glitter faintly with Essence, pulsing like veins under skin. Just walking this close makes my chest tighten. As if the river knows I’m here. As if it’s waiting.

As we trek deeper, Ronan starts explaining the creatures we might run into. Tactics. Weak points. Group formations. It’s not just casual info-dump—it’s survival now. We’re not here to spar with each other anymore. The forest itself is the test, and this test might kill us.

And it doesn’t take long to throw the syllabus out the window.

Because, of course, the first thing we run into...

Is a freaking Mossback.

I guess they love my presence. This one’s even bigger than the last one I tackled alone two months ago.

Without wasting a second, Ronan took charge as Aurora and I quickly moved out of the way. The ground cracked and split—Aurora manifested a barrage of piercing glass spikes all around the Mossback, forcing the beast to stumble and lose its footing. As it staggered, it let out a guttural growl and lunged forward in a heavy leap. I started hurling stones at its face and limbs, trying to pull its attention away. The distraction worked. The Mossback turned toward me with a rage-filled glare—just enough time for Ronan to close the distance.

His foot slammed down, dirt burst behind him, and he launched himself into the air—fist pulled back, about to land a solid punch.

And just then… something very unexpected happened.

Right before his punch could connect, Ronan halted mid-air. Completely froze. Aurora, who had been standing beside me with another spike spell half-formed, stopped too—stiff as stone.

They weren’t looking at the Mossback anymore.

They were both staring at the man who had just appeared—standing calmly on a tree branch above us.

He had crop cut blond hair, neatly kept. Around six feet tall, athletic build, light skin, and hazel eyes that looked sharp yet tired. His features were clean, striking even—handsome, but not in an overdone way. He wore a long black coat that swayed slightly in the wind. The same coat we’d seen before—back when we encountered those three men. And now he stood there, just watching.

Before we could react, he dropped down silently between me and the Mossback. A wave of Essence surged from him, clean and sharp—I felt it before I could even register what he was doing.

And then… a hole the size of a human head appeared clean through the Mossback’s chest, right where its heart should’ve been.

It died instantly. Crashed forward without a sound. Not a twitch. Not a groan.

That man… he was strong. Way stronger than me. Stronger than Aurora. Stronger even than Ronan.

I couldn’t sense his core, couldn’t read his presence. He wasn’t just at Full Stage Ascendant. He was above it—definitely above.

A thousand thoughts started racing through my mind.

And then Aurora let out a sudden, trembling gasp.

“Master Julian…” she whispered, her voice cracking as she ran toward him.

At the same moment, Ronan—still stunned—began walking in his direction as well.

Is this really him? Julian? Aurora’s master… Ronan’s old friend? Did they really find him—just like that, here in the middle of nowhere?

But the moment didn’t hold for long.

Reality slammed into us.

“Where the hell have you been, you idiot!” Ronan snapped as he picked up pace. “Your student—your damn kid—has been searching for you for half a year! Don’t you have a brain? Do you even get what leaving her alone has done to her?”

Aurora threw her arms around Julian and started crying silently.

And then everything shifted.

Ronan, who had been walking calmly, suddenly dashed forward. He yanked Aurora away from Julian with a sharp pull.

And that’s when I understood.

That’s when I saw it.

The exact same way Julian had channeled his Essence to kill the Mossback... he was about to use it on her.

“Huh?” Aurora blinked, confused and hurt. “What are you doing, Ronan? Let go of me! Why did you pull me back?”

“Stop, Aurora,” Ronan said through clenched teeth. “He’s—”

“Let me go! Julian, tell him to let go of me!” Aurora struggled, clearly furious. “Julian—tell him!”

“AURORA!” Ronan shouted. “Listen to me! He’s not right. Just now—he was about to launch an attack. On you.”

“What?” she snapped. “That’s insane! Why would Julian attack me? What’s wrong with you?”

“No Aurora,” I jumped in, my voice steady, “I saw it too. He was about to use the same attack he used on that Mossback. Same energy.”

Julian didn’t say a word. He just stood there—silent, motionless, watching us with a cold expression.

“What are you saying?” Aurora looked between us, her voice breaking. “Why would Julian ever hurt me? There’s no way… no way… Master, please say something. Tell them they’re wrong. You love me more than anyone. You’d never…”

She stepped forward, her voice trembling—

“You’d never hurt me… you—”

Clap. Clap. Clap.

Two men appeared from the shadows.

The sound of clapping echoed through the tense silence, drawing our attention. Two figures appeared from the shadows, both cloaked in black. The first was human, with fair skin, standing just as tall as Julian. His build was that of a seasoned fighter, his face hidden behind a red-and-black masquerade mask. The other was a massive figure—even bigger than Ronan, and definitely not human. His fair skin looked almost too pale, and the mask on his face seemed too small for his features. I couldn’t sense either of their Essence pools, which meant they were both at least full stage Ascendant.

The larger of the two spoke first, his voice booming with authority. "Who are you, and why are you causing trouble for my buddy Julian here?"

In an instant, I realized the gravity of the situation. Any wrong move could mean our deaths. Ronan paused, taking a few seconds to collect himself before answering. "Julian. He's our friend. We've been traveling find—"

"What?? Is that true, Julian? You have friends here?" the big guy interrupted, his voice dripping with disbelief.

Julian, standing tall but clearly struggling to maintain control, replied flatly, “They’re not my friends. Nor do I know them. And I’m not saying this because you asked. I just don’t want Azrael misunderstanding anything.”

Before any of us could react, the giant appeared in front of Julian, moving with a speed that left me stunned. Without warning, he landed a crushing punch to Julian’s gut. "That’s Master Azrael for you," the big guy chuckled.

Julian dropped to his knees, visibly winded. At the sight of his pain, Ronan rushed to his side, but the same fate befell him. In a blur of movement, Brutus—the massive man—punched Ronan with the same devastating force, sending him flying several meters away near the river.

Aurora was frozen, unable to speak, her face pale with shock. There was no way I could’ve defended myself against that punch, had it been aimed at me. I couldn’t even react fast enough to save myself.

"Calm down, Brutus. I don’t mind," the second figure—smaller and quieter—said, his tone cold.

Julian, slowly recovering, managed to stand up and said, "Let’s go, Master Azrael. We don’t have much time. We need to find her. According to Loki the Guardian is here, somewhere near the Silverlake Estuary."

Guardian? She? The last time we encountered those guys, they were hunting Skye. Are they here for her again?

Panic sets in. I start looking around, desperate. No signs of Skye. She was with us just minutes ago. I literally saw her staring at me before we encountered that Mossback. Where did she go? It's a relief she's not here, but why are they hunting Skye? Are they really after her, or am I just connecting too many dots?

As I tried to piece everything together, Ronan suddenly exploded with Essence, charging straight toward Brutus, ready to engage. But just as Ronan neared, a figure appeared out of nowhere in front of Brutus, blocking his path. 

The figure is small, maybe five and a half feet tall. He seems human, black hair, looking around my age—maybe a few years older. But just as I try to sense his Essence, my mind goes blank.

Monster.

How was this possible? His Essence pool was... off the charts. There was no way I could compare it to mine, or even Ronan's. His Essence was easily ten times that of Zane’s, and I didn’t think even Zane could fight this anomaly.

He held a sword, and as he took a stance, the air seemed to vibrate with raw power. Ronan, who is barreling toward Brutus with reckless rage. As the unknown figure steps in, Ronan halts and screams, “Summer, take Aurora and run! Don’t—”

Slash.

The next thing I saw was a flash of crimson.

Ronan’s right arm was gone. Clean cut.

The sword-wielder dashed forward, and his blade, once silver, now burned with crimson light, the Essence swirling around it like fog.
