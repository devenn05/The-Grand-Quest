Just like that, Ronan was pretty much neutralized. The difference between us and these guys was too much—we were like mice standing in front of lions.

The guy named Azrael spoke again, “Calm down, old man. We’re not here to fight you. Don’t cause any more trouble. We’ll leave.”

As he said that, he glanced at the man with the sword—and just like that, the man vanished into thin air, the same way he had appeared. Ashes twisted through the air like smoke, unraveling the figure back into nothingness. It was as if he had never been there—ashes forming flesh, and now ashes again scattering to the wind.

I knew exactly how painful it was for Ronan. I’d felt it myself. The difference was, Ronan had far better control over his body. He didn’t waste time. He stopped his own bleeding and stood silently, next to Aurora, who looked mentally shattered.

She wasn’t crying.

She wasn’t talking.

She wasn’t showing a damn thing.

Completely devastated.

“Let’s go from here, Master Azrael. We’ve already wasted our time here,” Julian said. “I wouldn’t have stopped if that mossback hadn’t appeared. We’ve been dealing with these creatures for days—they keep ambushing—and I thought taking care of him while he was distracted would be easy, so I did it.”

“It’s okay, Julian. Don’t explain. It’s fine,” Azrael replied calmly. “I know there’s nothing to misunderstand here.”

Just then—

“Or is it?”

He released his essence.

A terrifying killing intent poured out with it.

It sent a bone-chilling spike through my spine.

Brutus, who had been grinning the whole time, immediately tensed up.

“Calm down, Azrael. I don’t think Julian is foolish enough to go against us,” Brutus said quickly.

“Exactly, Master Azrael,” Julian replied in a polite, humble tone. “I have no intention of betraying you. Nor do I know them. I don’t know why that girl or that guy called me their master and friend. I have no recollection of them. Ever.”

Ronan’s expression darkened at those words. His face visibly sank.

Aurora, on the other hand—still as before. No reaction. Nothing.

We didn’t move. We had no intention of facing them. Only death lay ahead, even if we had tried. 

I had no chance. Not even using Spatial Realm in some way could save me here. I don’t think my Stonefist would work on those two. Julian, maybe. I could damage him while being in Spatial Realm.

But Azrael and Brutus?

Yeah. No chance.

My hands would probably shatter even trying to hit them with stonefist.

They began to move.

Just then, Azrael stopped—and turned his gaze toward Ronan.

“Have you seen a cat around here?” he asked.

Fuck.

Why did he have to bring that up now? Do we need to tell him about Skye? No. Please don’t, Ronan.

Don’t tell them.

Whatever their intentions are, they’re clearly not noble. I don’t care if she never comes back to us—I just don’t want them to get even a hint of her.

“A cat? In this forest?” Ronan asked, genuinely puzzled.

A brutal punch to his gut—Brutus again, moving without hesitation, “Don’t make him fucking repeat himself, donkey. Did you see any cat around? Yes or no? A Grey or orange cat?”

It was painful to watch Ronan being tossed around like he was nothing.

Every blow sank deeper into me—not on my body, but on my worth. How weak I was. How little I mattered. They didn’t even *see* me. I was just a fucking roach, watching lions tear apart a fox.

“No... we didn’t encounter any cat,” Ronan said, wincing. “We fought some howlers... and then this mossback. Nothing else.”

“That’s how easy it was, you buffoon. Now lay back.”

Another punch to his gut.

Ronan collapsed.

I was just standing there. By the river, on the edge, off to the side—useless. I clenched my fists. Gritted my teeth.

And that’s when Azrael’s eyes fell on me.

“You.”

Looking at me now.

“Is he telling the truth?”

He channeled something I wasn’t ready for—a surge of pure essence, layered with killing intent. It crashed into me like a tidal wave. My bones went cold. My teeth began to chatter. My hands, wet with sweat. My body didn’t just freeze—it vibrated, like it was trying to run while being nailed to the ground. I couldn’t even scream.

“What’s wrong with these guys? They never answer the damn question the first time,” Brutus muttered.

Is he going to hit me next?

“N… No. I don’t know… anything.”

Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

That was not at all convincing. Please don’t catch. Fuck.

Azrael, who had been facing ahead, turned and started walking towards me.

Each step he took screamed death in my mind. What the hell have I done? I started regretting all of it with every one of his steps. Did I survive all that, just to die at the hands of this fucker?

Just like that he was right in front of me now. Looking straight into my eyes.

 My body stiff, completely gave up.

“Did you know where the cat is? Tell me the truth,” he asked again.

I replied with nothing, just staring at him.

A part of me wanted to just say that she’s been travelling with us—in fact, she was with us just moments before you guys showed up—but I just couldn’t. I couldn’t muster the courage to abandon Skye like that, like she was nothing. She already saved our lives once. Maybe it was our destiny to die in this forest. She just gave us a month’s stretch.

That’s when a figure appeared again, out of nowhere—similar to before, forming from ashes into a solid person.

But this time, it was someone else.

A woman.

She was around my height. Brown hair. Striking face. Her presence felt unnerving—she had an eerie, unreal kind of beauty that didn’t belong here, like a predator in disguise. There was a calmness in her walk that made your gut twist, like she was already sure how this would end.

“If you don’t speak in the next ten seconds, she’ll scan your memory,” Azrael said. “She’ll get the information we want—if you have it—and then kill you. And after that, I will kill that elf girl and that bald guy over there.”

Damn this fucker.

What the hell am I supposed to do?

“Don’t you dare say anything to him, Summer!”

Out of the blue, Aurora screamed at me.

“Julian, stop this nonsense right now. I don’t know why you’re with these guys, but we’re here because we came searching for you. I don’t want others to suffer because of us, because of me. Stop your friends here. We don’t know anything about this cat!”

She’s completely lost it, hasn’t she? There’s no way this Julian guy is the same person they once knew.

“Julian, are you really sure you don’t know her, man? ‘Cause she definitely knows you.”

Brutus stepped forward. “Well, there’s only one way to make this bitch shut her mouth up.”

He charged at Aurora.

Julian didn’t move an inch.

Ronan jumped in front of her to protect her, but Brutus kicked him aside like nothing and reached Aurora.

Then he punched her.

The impact was brutal. She immediately lost consciousness, a hellish amount of blood pouring from her mouth. Her belly took the hit worst—one look and I knew it was serious. The force of the punch threw her several meters away, landing her near us—me, Azrael, and this mysterious woman.

“You. Speak. I don’t have patience for all this. If I don’t hear something from you in the next few seconds, all three of you are gonna die.”

This was it, wasn’t it?

I glanced at Aurora, unconscious and bleeding right beside us. Then looked toward Ronan, a few meters away.

Our eyes met.

He gave me a smile. No words were necessary.

I turned my eyes back to Azrael.

“You want to know where the cat is?”

I let out a short chuckle. A laugh.

“Fuck you. Run your dicks off trying to find her. I’m not gonna tell you anything.”

I knew what was coming for me. But damn… that felt so fucking good.

That feeling of not breaking... of choosing your own end… that’s the kind of freedom no one can take.

“Well, it was nice meeting you,” Azrael said, as the woman reached out to grab me.

*Use Spatial Realm, Summer. It’s me—Skye. Don’t ask how I’m talking to you through your mind or how I know about spatial realm. I’ll explain later. Use it when I say. Grab Aurora and jump into the river. I’ll handle the rest.*

What…? Skye?

Just as the woman’s fingers were about to touch me, I activated Spatial Realm.

I grabbed Aurora—and jumped into the river.

Without thinking, without knowing what was going to happen next, I jumped.

While falling, I caught one last glimpse of Ronan.

He looked relieved.

### Ronan’s POV

Huh?

What’s happening to those two?

They’re frozen... mid-air? That woman—she looks like she stopped while running. And Azrael... he’s different. Stiff. Stuck. It’s not just them—something’s wrong with the space itself.

I shouted, “Summer, what are you doing?!”

But Brutus had already started running too. “Azrael! What are you doing?!”

And before I could say another word—Summer grabbed Aurora and jumped into the river.

Our eyes met as he leapt.

And in that brief moment, I saw it—Sadness.

I didn’t know what happened or how it happened, but I wanted to tell him, “It’s okay. You guys survive. I’ll figure something out. I’ll meet you later.” Even though I knew they’d probably kill me, I still wanted him—and Aurora—to make it out of this. So I gave a small, relieved smile.

And just like that, they vanished into the fearsome current.

And just like that, everything that had been frozen in space snapped back to normal.

Was it Skye who did something?

No—Summer had released his essence. It was him.

But how?

The space around Azrael and that woman had frozen for a few seconds—two, maybe three.

Even Brutus looked confused.

“Azrael, what the hell just happened man?! Why did you just stand there and let them escape?!”

Azrael didn’t respond. Not at first.

Then, the woman with him—vanished. Ashes again.

And Azrael erupted. A scream full of fury, essence flaring wild across the air like an explosion.

“FUCKKKKKKKK! What did he do to me?!”

Then his eyes landed on me. I didn’t even have time to move. He charged like a demon, grabbed me by the throat, lifting me—me, a seven-foot beastkin—like I was a toy.

“What did he do?! How did he escape me?!” he asked.

“I... I have no idea.”

And I meant it. I truly had no clue what just happened.

“Azrael, calm down!” Brutus barked, “Use Cinder. He won’t say anything.”

Right then, the woman who had vanished before reappeared in front of us. Ashes to form. Just like before. Azrael didn’t even blink—he tossed me straight toward her like I was an object.

“Cinder, is it?” I asked, trying to buy seconds, breath, anything.

She didn’t reply. I still had no idea how they were doing this—spawning, vanishing. But one thing was clear—Azrael was behind it all. This woman—Cinder—was his summon, or creation. Or something worse.

She placed both her hands on my head. I didn’t fight. I couldn’t.

“I don’t know what you’ll see,” I muttered, “But you won’t find the cat. She’s smart. And whatever Summer did to you… I’ve got no clue. So… good luck.”

And just like that—

I lost consciousness.
