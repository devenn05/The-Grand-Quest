Chapter 13: Beyond the Edge

*Decapitation.*

It wouldn’t kill Draven outright, but without his head? His body would stop functioning. He’d be useless. At least for a while. And that would give me enough time to figure out my next move.

Could I pull it off, though?

I had no sword. No weapons. My aura was nearly depleted. Draven’s skin? Tougher than steel. A clean cut through his neck? *Impossible*.

But I wasn’t out of options yet.

Draven’s footsteps grew louder. His figure loomed closer, blocking out the dim torchlight. My mind scrambled. I needed a weapon, something sharp enough to make that cut. The cave was full of jagged rocks—something, *anything*—but nothing that could do the job.

Then, a flash of memory hit me.

Zane’s face appeared in my mind, clear as day.

**A lesson with Zane.**

---

“You think this half-hearted effort will take you anywhere?” Zane’s voice cut through my thoughts like a knife.
A much younger me sat there on the training grounds, drenched in sweat, exhausted. I was struggling—so hard—trying and failing to pull my aura into my arms. Something so basic for an Essence Manipulator. It was supposed to be simple, but in that moment? It felt impossible.
I could feel Zane’s eyes on me, piercing, relentless, but I didn’t dare look up. I was too busy trying to make sense of the energy, to make something work. My aura just wasn’t listening to me.
"I know you’re struggling," Zane’s voice softened for a moment, almost like he was trying to calm me down. "You’re overthinking it. You’re trying to force something that won’t come naturally."
His words hit me like a hammer. He was right. I was overthinking it. My mind raced a thousand miles per minute, trying to figure out the “right” way to make it happen, trying to live up to something I couldn’t even grasp yet.
"You’re constantly being compared to your sister. You feel like you have to meet everyone’s expectations. But that pressure? That doubt? It’s all meaningless—until you’re in a position where you truly need to make it happen."
His words stung. Celestia... she had always been so strong, so perfect. And then there was me, always falling short. But Zane wasn’t done.
"The moment you reach that breaking point, it will either consume you... or you’ll break past your limits."
I could feel the truth in his words, burning in my chest. I wasn’t just training my body. I was training my mind—my spirit—to face that moment. To push past whatever this doubt was, whatever these limits I had in my head.
"Until then, focus on refining your aura distribution.”

---

Draven was nearly on me. The ground shook with his heavy steps. I could feel the heat of his aura—his presence pressing down on me like an iron weight.

I clenched my fists. **This was it.** My breaking point. My last shot.

The only way to survive was to use **Energy Transformation**—the technique I’d been too weak to pull off, too untrained to manage in any real battle. But now? With death staring me in the face, there was no choice but to try.

My aura felt like a flicker of a flame in my chest, too weak to do anything. Could I gather it in time? **Impossible.**

*But I had to.* I didn’t have a choice.

“D-Don’t come any closer! Stay away!” I stammered, forcing the words out through gritted teeth. I had to pretend, to feign fear—make Draven think he had the upper hand.

I could feel the sneer in his gaze. The arrogance. He wasn’t fooled. He saw right through it, taking my words lightly as he moved closer, his guard half-lowered, convinced of his superiority.

*Pathetic.*

His confidence bled through the air. He thought I was nothing. And that’s what would kill him.

Chuckling, Draven gathered his own aura, the energy humming with dangerous intensity. He was a second away from **decapitating me.** I could feel it, the weight of the blade in his hand, ready to bring it down on my neck.

But as his shadow loomed over me, one thought repeated over and over in my mind:

**"I have to do this….."**

I pushed every ounce of my broken body into the movement. Every last drop of aura, every fragment of willpower. My vision blurred. My body screamed at me to stop. My head throbbed as if my brain was going to crack in half from the strain.

*But I couldn’t stop.*

And then—just as Draven’s attack was within inches of me—

**SNAP.**

**BOOM.**

The world twisted. The last thing Draven saw was the crack of my fingers, and in that single instant, his entire world flipped upside down.

Confusion raked through him. For a split second, he was disoriented, lost. He found himself staring at the ground, the rough, dirt-covered cave floor beneath him.

He felt… *distant*. Like his body wasn’t even his own.

Then he felt it—a sudden tug, a tightness around his hair.

His gaze darted up, and when his eyes met mine, his mouth opened, but no sound came out. The world slowed. Time seemed to stretch.

**I was holding his head by the hair.**

I wasn’t sure if it was blood, sweat, or both dripping down my face, but I didn’t care. All I could focus on was his lifeless eyes staring back at me. I grinned, slow and cold. The blood on my lips didn’t seem so terrible now.

*"It wasn’t very wise of you to underestimate this ‘brat,’ was it?*" I whispered, my voice a chill that cut through the dark cave.

“*You were going to feast on me, right?*” I tilted his head, letting my words hang between us like the calm before a storm. "*Well, let's see how you do that now."*

Without hesitation, I drove my fingers **straight into his eyes**, feeling the soft, sickening pop as his vision was torn away from him.

Draven screamed—his voice warping with an inhuman pitch that rattled my bones.

Next, I tore off his ears—shredding his ability to hear anything, turning his desperate cries into meaningless wails.

Draven wailed in a panic, helpless.

With a sick, twisted smirk, I reached for his nose—ripped it off, leaving him without any sense of smell.

The once-mighty vampire was now reduced to **nothing but a blind, deaf, disfigured head.**
