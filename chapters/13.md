It’s been four days since the fight with those men.

The cat? In my arms.

We’re traveling north together.

Our speed has been insane — we’ve almost covered a distance in five days that took me over a week before, even if you don’t count the day we fought.

So many questions. Who were those three guys? Why did they attack us? Who is this cat? What is a freaking cat doing here? How is she this strong? Why isn’t she hurting us? Why did she help us? Now I understand why we couldn't sense her—she's a freakin' full stage Ascendant monster with a fully developed essence core. 

Never in my life did I think I’d be carrying a... whatever she even is.

A cat? A beast? A creature?

I don’t even know anymore.

I just really hope I find some damn answers soon.

But, yeah... her fur is really soft and nice.

“She’s really become fond of you, Summer. But be very careful with her. We’re a second away from her deciding to kill us,” Ronan says, frowning.

I don’t know why she’s decided to stick around us, but Ronan’s right. She could kill us whenever she wanted.

And for some reason, she only stays close to me.

Ronan’s scared of her — I can see it every time he looks at her.

Aurora’s the opposite. She’s drawn to her. But she’s been... down ever since that fight.

I can guess why.

“Ronan, how did you defeat the first guy? And mainly, how did you defeat the mist guy? He was attacking while being invisible, right?” I ask.

“Yeah. The first guy? I don’t even remember. I just punched him and he was pretty much dead. As for the mist guy... I let him hit me. Just as he was closing in, I grabbed him and beat the shit out of him. Took me a few minutes to land a clean grab, but yeah, a couple of punches were enough. The real problem was that other one. But, well... our friend here took care of him. I just wish we could’ve asked who he was talking about. And this Julian he mentioned.”

Aurora’s face drops immediately.

“No, Ronan. Even if my master is missing... I don’t think he would ever keep company with people like them.”

Trying to console her, I say, “Exactly. There are tons of Julians out there. No way your master is hanging out with guys like that. Even though I don’t know him, I can tell from the way you describe him — he has a kind soul.”

“I hope you’re right, Summer. Both of you,” Ronan says softly.

As we talk, the cat keeps staring at us like she understands every damn word. And it’s not just now—she’s been like from start.

Yesterday, I even tried calling her over like a maniac. Told her, “Come here, I’ve got fish for you.”

Did she come?

Hell no.

She didn’t even blink. Just sat there and started licking her own paw like I was beneath her.

The answer couldn’t have been clearer.

She really thinks she’s royalty.

“Ah, Summer. You feel any difference after changing your essence training?” Ronan asks suddenly.

“Yes, Ronan. It’s actually crazy. Before, I could barely manage fifteen seconds. Honestly, a month ago I couldn’t even hold it for ten. It took four weeks to go from ten to fifteen... but just in this one week? I’m already hitting twenty. And my Essence Core’s grown a little too, I think.”

I glance down at the cat in my arms. “If I wasn’t carrying Her Highness here, I’d still be doing my old training method while walking. Better than nothing.”

Right then, she digs her claws into my forearm. Not deep. Just a warning.

I wince and mutter under my breath.

This bitch definitely understands what I’m saying.

“That’s great to hear,” Ronan nods. “Get it to a minute and I’ll show you something even more useful. Stronger, too.”

Then, in a quiet voice, Aurora speaks.

“What should I do to get strong, Ronan?”

She’s not confident. I can tell. Her voice is low, uncertain.

Ronan pauses. His expression shifts, more serious now.

“In the three months we’ve been together, you’ve never asked me for help, brat. Why now?”

“Because… I saw how weak I still am. What’s the point of reaching Half-Ember if all I could do was get hurt and black out when it actually mattered? I should’ve been there, Ronan. I should’ve fought beside you. I want to get stronger — strong enough to stand on my own….To look him in the eye one day and say, ‘Even without you, I didn’t stop. I grew. I kept going.’”

I believe her. Every word. And judging by Ronan’s silence, so does he.

There’s a fire in her voice. The kind that can’t be faked.

“How about I give you some combat and Essence lessons while we travel?” he offers.

I perk up at that. I want to get stronger too. I need to.

Being weak won’t get me back home.

That last battle? It slapped the arrogance right out of me.

I thought having Spatial Realm made me untouchable. It doesn’t. It just made me lazy.

Sure, it sounds like a cheat—blink from point A to B, ignore distance, slip through space... sounds unstoppable, right?

Wrong.

It’s got limits. A tight range. Short duration. Eats up Essence like crazy.

Use it wrong—or worse, let the enemy figure it out—and that’s it. Game over.

Honestly? If I knew how Spatial Realm worked, even I could beat me.

Just don’t let me close. Stay out of range. Use projectiles. Zone me out.

That dagger guy? If he’d just hurled those invisible blades at me—I'd be dead. I could dodge the regular ones, sure. But the one which I couldn’t sense—Those were straight-up “You Lose” cards waiting to be played.

“Please, Ronan. I’d really appreciate the help.”

I say it as politely as I can.

“Yes, Ronan. Me too. Help us get stronger,” Aurora adds.

He nods, arms crossed.

“Alright. We’ll start tomorrow.”

Aurora frowns. “Why not now?”

“Easy, Queen. I get it—you’re fired up. But rushing won’t make you strong overnight. Half the day’s gone already. Let’s cover more ground and then set camp.”

Aurora pouts but doesn’t argue.

We keep moving.

The sun’s already flirting with the horizon.

We must’ve covered ten to twelve kilometers today. Daylight really boosts our pace—way better than my old night walks, I don’t know how but it did.

“Ronan, how long till we reach Silverlake? Still far?” I ask.

“About fifteen to twenty days, if things go the way I planned.”

“Huh? What have you planned exactly?” Aurora asks, suspicious.

Ronan just smirks. “You’ll see starting tomorrow. For now, let’s find a good camping spot. I’m starving.”

We found a decent spot near the edge of the forest, and as usual, Ronan starts setting up the tent without saying much. Aurora and I head off to gather firewood, and the cat—who we’ve started calling Skye—leaps out of my arms. She scampers up a nearby tree with practiced ease and lounges on a branch like it’s her throne.

Well, we didn’t name her. That was all Aurora. Said it was because of her eyes—“Blue like the sky,” she claimed.

I glance up at Skye, watching her tail flick lazily in the breeze.

“So,” I say, breaking the silence, “what do you think Ronan’s gonna make us do tomorrow?”

Aurora shrugs, hoisting a bundle of twigs. “Honestly, I’ve got no clue. I’ve never seen him train anyone before. But… he does have a reputation. Back in Stanfort, people talk about him and my master like they’re two of the best.” She pauses. “Guess we’ll find out tomorrow.” Then she adds, “Anyway, tell me more about your family. I know you're from a noble line in Lunaris—but what else?”

I hesitate for a second. Then sigh.

“I’m not just from any noble line. My father’s a Marquess. He governs nearly a third of Lunaris. My mother’s a Primordium user too.” I trail off. “And I… have a sister.”

Aurora perks up. “Wait, you have a sister? Older or younger? That must be nice—having a sibling.”

“Her name’s Celestia,” I say. “She went missing when I was nine.”

The air goes quiet for a beat too long.

Aurora’s face drops. “I… I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to bring any bad memories up for you Summer.”

I wave her off with a half-smile, even though the weight hasn’t left my chest. “It’s fine. Don’t feel bad. I’ve kind of gotten used to it. Honestly, I don’t even remember that much about her anymore.”

That part’s a lie.

Aurora lowers her gaze. “I can't say I understand, but... I can imagine, at least a little. Not trying to compare or anything.”

“It’s alright.” I shake my head and force a grin. “Let’s drop the gloom, yeah? Tell me about you. How’d you get so strong at your age?”

She brightens up a bit at that. “Julian’s been training me since I was nine when I awakened. Since he’s a Manifestor too, it made the lessons easier to absorb. He’s strict, but fair. I guess I just learned fast. Before I knew it, I broke into early Ember, then Half Ember.”

I nod, but I’m stunned. That kind of growth rate is… terrifying. Humans awaken later than most races, sure, but Aurora's progress is just mental. She already comparable to my mother. Another couple years and she’ll surpass her.

“So what’s the plan?” I ask. “I mean, with all this strength—what do you want to do with it?”

Aurora thinks for a moment. “Haven’t really decided. But I know I want to become someone like Julian. He’s always been this… constant force.  He loves research and exploring. Few Months also he was researching something related to History and roots of our Essence. He used to be a general in Avalon’s army before becoming an instructor. That’s how he found me. And Ronan? They go way back—same era, same battlefield.” She smiles. “Julian’s turning forty this year. Ronan too.”

“Huh,” I say, surprised. “Ronan doesn’t look forty.”

“He looks sixty,” she shoots back, laughing.

We both crack up, and with arms full of firewood, we head back to camp.

“Hey, old man, what’s for dinner?” Aurora teases.

“Brat, I’m still in my twenties. Who are you calling old?” Ronan grumbles from behind the half-built firepit.
“No, seriously,” I say, cracking a half-smile. 

Ever since I started traveling with these two, a lot of things have changed. I’m still on the road, still moving every day, but it doesn’t feel insane anymore. Not like the way I was wandering last month—half-dead, half-lost, like some wild animal chasing a direction rather than a destination.

Now I’ve got a rhythm. And thanks to Ronan, I’m not wearing rags anymore. Real clothes. Real boots. He tossed them my way like it was nothing, didn’t even mention how or why he had my size. I didn’t ask either. With him, nothing surprises me anymore. That bag of his—it’s like a damn Doraemon’s pocket. You need something? He’s probably got it tucked in there, waiting to be pulled out like it was always meant to be yours. Extra sets of clothes, sharpening tools, you name it. The man’s mysterious, but I’ve learned it’s better not to question it.

> Doraemon's pocket: It is a fictional, 4-dimensional pouch from a popular Japanese manga and anime series Doraemon, known for producing an endless array of futuristic gadgets.

And for the first time in what feels like forever, water wasn’t a rare miracle. Back when I was alone, I had next to no water, all dry and still kept walking. Manipulators like me—we can stretch things out. We don’t need water and food the same way an average person does. Not all the time. But Aurora? She’s different. Manifestors are more grounded, more dependent on the real, the physical. She doesn’t need as much as a normal person either, but compared to Ronan and me, she’s still the one who gets thirsty first, the one who starts slowing down when we push too far without stopping. 

But really, eating food was something I do without thinking twice. Shamelessly I asked Ronen, “What’s on the menu tonight? Dinner’s been the highlight of my day lately. That month without real food—just Essence and all that! Yeah, I don’t ever want to experience that again.”

“Smoked meat tonight,” Ronan says, licking his lips.

My eyes light up. Even Skye hops down from her perch.

We laugh. We eat. We let the fire warm our sore legs and tired souls.

And as the flames crackle and the sky darkens, a quiet calm settles over us. Tomorrow, everything changes. New routines. New challenges. New strength.
