I sit up slowly, rubbing my eyes, the cool air biting at my skin.

That’s when I see it.

A surge of adrenaline hits me—sharp and instant. No thought. No pause. I’m already running.

What I see—it’s a fire. A bonfire. Not huge, but real. Controlled. Definitely made by someone—someone with hands and intention. Not a random natural flame. Not lightning.

Definitely not something you'd expect on a gods-damned beach.

Not here. Not now.

So I start running like a haiwan toward it.

And while I run, questions hit me like arrows. What if I actually meet whoever made that fire? Would they help me? Harm me? Kill me? Honestly, staying here alone in this cursed jungle is already its own kind of slow death. So... might as well gamble. Maybe they’ll be friendly. Maybe they’re a walker like me.

The descent this time is merciful—compared to the last two. It’s more of a steep slope, maybe fifty, sixty degrees. Not the vertical cliffs of doom I’ve had to deal with before. I’m half-jogging down it, sliding here and there, but the forest’s thinner on this stretch. I’m not crashing through every damn branch like a madman.

And even though the sun isn’t fully up yet, I can see its bleeding edge. A sliver of deep red cutting through the distant waves like the eye of a waking god. Just the tip of it pushing past the horizon.

……

The fire’s right there, flickering softly like it still remembers the warmth of its creator.

But no one’s around.

Damn it.

I took a slow walk around.

Two wooden logs sit as makeshift seats around the bonfire, the bark rough and weathered. Scattered bones lie nearby, charred and picked clean—probably leftovers from whatever they ate. The heat still lingers in the air, the warmth clinging faintly to the bones. Whoever they were, they couldn’t have left more than an hour or two ago.

I spot some footprints. Several sets, each with different footwear, their impressions still fresh in the earth.

Just missed them.

Disappointing, yeah.

Following the tracks now would be tough. Sun’s still too low. I’ll have to wait for a proper sunrise. Once there’s enough light, I’ll follow them—assuming they didn’t head north.

If they did... bummer.

No way I’m going north.

So I sit down on one of the logs. Might as well enjoy a lovely bonfire on a beautiful beach, I mutter to myself, grinning like an idiot.

The fire crackles softly in response.

After a few minutes, I push myself to my feet. No point in wasting time. I shake off the lingering fatigue and start training again.

My Essence feels full. Ten hours of sleep—who knew it could do wonders? I feel... sharp. I begin channeling my Essence into my left hand, focusing hard, trying to maintain it for as long as I can.

My current limit’s around ten, maybe eleven seconds.

Two weeks ago, I could barely hold it for two. Crazy good progress.

Since my left hand’s dominant, I can squeeze out two or three seconds more on it compared to my right, which caps out around seven or eight.

Channeling Essence through my whole body’s easier—like throwing a blanket. But funneling it into just one hand? That’s like pouring water into a pot with a tiny opening.

Precise. Annoying.

I couldn’t even do this before. Not really. So either my control’s gotten better, or my Essence pool’s grown. Probably both. Or maybe... it’s just my mentality. Smirk.

Anyway, fish’s in the net now. Might as well grill it.

So I keep at it for about an hour—left, right, left again. No real improvement, but I wasn’t expecting miracles.

It’s about time I start following the tracks.

The sun’s up now. Gold streaks stretch over the ocean like someone spilled a pot of molten metal across the horizon.

And the tracks? Yeah. They’re heading south.

Three different sets of footprints.

The coastline’s straight enough that I can see maybe two, three kilometers ahead—and still, no sign of them. If they’re on foot, they’re probably five or six kilometers out by now.

So I start walking.

While I move, I practice. Channeling Essence into my hands in short bursts. The shaking from each step throws off control—it’s harder than when I’m still. Time drops, but I’m adjusting. I keep a close eye on my reserves, never letting them dip below seventy percent. Gotta stay ready. Maybe I’ll run into another Mossback willing to lend me a leafy hand for friendship.

Essence into one hand. Then the other. Again. Again. The rhythm settles into me, gives the hours some kind of shape.

It’s becoming instinct now. With luck, I’ll hit Full Stage Ascendant by week’s end.

I mix in some physical work too—push-ups, squats, stretches, shadowboxing. Just enough to keep the blood moving, the pain honest.

*“Only Essence isn't gonna make me Emperor, Alfred, is it?”* I mutter, half-laughing to myself.

*"I’m so smart, Alfred. Aren’t I?"*

*"Yes, Master. A prodigy. A future Emperor of Avalon. The current emperor must surely step down soon and declare your brilliance to the world. Your Essence training? Flawless. Revolutionary. Genius."*

*"I know, I know,"* I answer with a smug little grin.

Gods, I’m really losing it out here.

Still no one. The moon’s high, silver light spilling across the ocean. The world feels still.

Eventually, I lie down to nap. I could keep moving, but I need to keep my mind sharp. Essence without food, without water, turns everything blurry.

I find a patch of soft sand under a tree. Stretch out beneath the moonlight. Close my eyes.

Beautiful night. Beautiful moon.

……

I wake up drenched in sweat, back sore, lips cracked dry. The crooked tree above had done its job, kept the sun off me through most of the morning. But by the time I blink into the light, it’s already climbed high—no longer just peeking over the horizon. Thirty, maybe forty degrees up. Not that I’m counting.

I don’t waste a second. I get up and start walking.

Bathing? Cleaning myself? Yeah, that’s a fantasy at this point. I’m one mud splatter away from being classified as native wildlife.

South. That’s it. That’s the only direction left that matters.

The western coast stretches forever. Seventeen hundred kilometers, if memory serves. By sunset, I figure I’ve made it to the halfway point—maybe a bit beyond. Not that it changes much. Port Ranchy, the only southern port I actually know by name, is still a far-off dream. That place might as well be on the moon.

At this point, I don’t even care which port. Any port. Any damn one will do. I’ve stopped hoping to find someone specific.

The rest of the day blurs. Just walking. Step after step. Then more of it. And more. And I know tomorrow’s going to bring the same.

---

Days pass.

Weeks maybe. I’ve stopped counting.

My body feels brutal. Like an animal. A haiwan, as they’d say back home. I’ve slipped into a routine now—travel at night, rest and train through the mornings. It’s been about two and a half weeks of this. Same coast. Same quiet. No sign of the port. No sign of them. Either they changed direction, or something else happened. I don’t know.

But my body’s adjusting. I feel it. The physical training’s starting to pay off—the soreness dulls quicker, my movements feel cleaner. Essence control’s tighter too. And the hardening technique? I’ve pushed it by three, maybe four more seconds.

Also... I renamed it.

Hardening Technique sounded like something out of a textbook. So I’m calling it Stonefist now. Simple. Solid. Once it gets stronger? Steelfist.

Aren’t I a genius? Emperor Summer, master of punch-based naming systems.

Anyway.

I’m settling into this worn-out rhythm. It’s not paradise, but it’s better than running into a Mossback or some nightmare creature out in the trees.

Tonight’s the same as usual—I’m walking, channeling Stonefist into my right hand, when I spot something.

Hope.

Ash. A scorched patch of ground. A ring of black dust, broken branches. Someone had a campfire here. Recently.

It’s still night. No—dawn’s close. That pale blue bleed pushing up over the stars.

They’re still on the coastal path.

I don’t even think. My legs are already moving—jogging, then sprinting. I decide right then: I’m not stopping tonight. No breaks. No sleep. I’ll chase this until my legs give out.

But the more distance I cover, the more that voice creeps in.

What if they’re already gone? Just another dead lead, like before?

Five minutes. Nothing. Ten. Twenty. Thirty. The fire’s already fading—probably gone ten minutes after I spotted it.

“Hard luck, Summer.” I mutter it aloud, just to break the silence.

Then I see them.

Distant flickers. Tiny shapes against the graying sky—ants, almost. Human ants.

I thunder forward. No hesitation. My body’s lit up. Chest heaving. Legs screaming. But I run like it’s life or death—because maybe it is.

As I get closer, they come into focus. Two figures.

Wait. Just two?

I remember three sets of footprints back at the clearing.

No time to think.

Because something’s near them.

Big.

Wrong.

Moving all wrong.

A Howler. 

As I close in, the scene sharpens—and my steps slow.

Piles of Howlers are scattered along the shore, their bodies twisted and still. Each one’s been killed the same way: a long, sharp spike—like ice or glass—juts clean through their bodies. No struggle. Just quiet, ugly death.

I freeze for a second, my gut twisting.

Who the hell are these two? How did they take down so many Howlers—and they’re not even moving?

They’re just standing there, side by side. Watching.

> **Howler** — A creature found near the southern shores of Avalon. It looks like a big wolf with dark gray fur that blends into the rocks and sand. On land, it moves low and fast, almost like it’s crawling. In water, it’s even quicker, using webbed claws and a strong tail to swim. Its pale eyes can see in the dark.
> 

I force myself to keep walking, slower now, careful. And just as I’m about to reach them—

The girl moves.

She’s got silver blonde hair, little messy. Sharp features—cheekbones high, nose small, and a mouth that looks like it barely smiles. Her ears, thin and pointed, mark her as an Elf. She lifts a hand casually, almost lazily—and from the ground, a spear of crystal-clear glass bursts upward, impaling a Howler that I hadn’t even noticed moving.

The man beside her doesn’t even flinch.

He’s massive—easily over seven feet—with a thick build that looks carved out of stone. His skin is dark, and his head’s completely bald, catching the faint light. A battered black eyepatch covers his left eye, and the one good eye that remains is a piercing green, sharp and alert. He looks like a human.

Both of them turn their eyes toward me at the same time.

We stare at each other across the bloody shore.

I lift my hands slowly, palms open—I’m not a threat, I need help, trying to say without words.

For a few heartbeats, it’s nothing but cold silence. Then the man’s voice cuts across the distance, deep and rough:

"What are you doing here, alone on this coast, far from any city? You look human. Why are you this deep into the western wilds of Avalon?"

I swallow. I need to be careful. Really careful.

I let a few seconds pass, gathering my thoughts before answering.

"I was abducted," I say, steady as I can. "They left me outside some cave about... forty, fifty kilometers back, maybe more. I’ve been following the coastline south ever since. I found some old campfire remains about three weeks ago—been tracking, hoping to catch up, maybe find a port if I got lucky. Thought I was chasing three people, though..."

"We’ve been traveling as a pair," he says, voice low but firm. "No third with us. Whoever you saw... it wasn’t us."

He shifts slightly, his eye narrowing, gauging me. "And for the record—we're moving north. Not south."

The words sink into me slow, heavy.

For a second, the only sound is the low whisper of waves brushing against the shore behind me.

What the hell?

They aren’t the one I’ve been chasing all this time…
