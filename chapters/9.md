Chapter 9: Whispering Walls: Part I

The air was damp, thick with the scent of wet stone and decay. Water dripped from the jagged stalactites above, creating an eerie rhythm that echoed through the cavernous space. A Cave.

My consciousness stirred. My head throbbed, limbs feeling heavy. Slowly, my eyes fluttered open, and the blurred outlines of my surroundings sharpened into focus.

I wasn’t alone.

A man sat before me—broad-shouldered, well-built, dressed in simple yet refined attire. His presence exuded strength, but something about him felt... off. As my senses adjusted, I realized.

That scent.

A thick, unmistakable aura clung to the air, sending a primal chill down my spine. I lifted my gaze. Dark, amused eyes met mine. And then, that man smiled.

Sharp. Elongated.

Fangs.

A vampire.

My heartbeat pounded crazily, mind racing. Vampires were a rarity—ghosts in history, myths whispered among terrified villagers. Few ever saw one in their lifetime, and even fewer lived to speak of it. If a vampire was an Essence Manipulator, their energy levels dwarfed those of ordinary humans. If they were Manifestors, they became even deadlier.

And if they possessed Reality Influence...

There was no research. No records. No survivors.

Panic clawed at my throat, but before it could consume me, recognition struck me like a lightning bolt.

This wasn’t just any vampire.

This man...

My eyes widened in horror.

"*You—*" My voice caught in my throat.

He smirked. “*Ah, so you do remember me……But before that, let me introduce to you myself. My Name is **Draven.*** ”

When Cedric and Lucian had met, a guard had stood beside Cedric, clad in Vale armor, a trusted knight within their ranks.

That same guard now sat before me.

“*You... you were one of Cedric Vale’s men. A guard of Dunford.*”

Draven let out a chuckle, stretching lazily. *“I was many things.*” His eyes gleamed with amusement. “*Funny, isn’t it? All those years I spent within your walls, and no one ever suspected a thing. A fake history, a fabricated background... and suddenly, I was a knight.*” He leaned forward, grinning. “*Your father, Cedric, Orion all ran in circles for years, desperately searching for the culprit behind the disappearances. If only they had looked a little closer.*”

I was so confused. “*So it was you. You’re behind the Black Veil Incident.*”

Draven tilted his head. “*Black Veil...*” He laughed, his voice dripping with amusement. “*How dramatic.*” He met my glare and flashed another sharp-toothed grin. “*Yes, I was the one responsible. But let’s be honest... I was right under their noses, and they never even considered me.*” His expression darkened. “*Humans are such fools.*”

I was trapped. Alone. Facing something I had no chance of fighting. Only a handful of people in Lunaris could stand against such a monster, and obviously, I was not one of them. Not even close.

While I was thinking, something shifted.

A flash of movement.

An arc of energy sliced through the air.

Pain.

Agonizing, searing pain.

My mind barely registering what had happened, my vision blurred as my body convulsed.

Then—I saw it.

My arm.

Gone.

The next thing I saw was Draven holding my severed arm close to his mouth. His fangs gleamed in the dim light as he sank them into the flesh.

The sickening sound of tearing. The sensation of bones cracking. Draven sighed in pleasure, licking the blood from his lips.

“*You taste even better than I expected,*” he murmured, his voice dripping with satisfaction.

My screams were raw, filled with agony. My body trembled uncontrollably, my mind barely able to grasp the sheer horror unfolding.

Draven chuckled. “*Oh, don’t pass out on me now.*” His grin widened, his crimson eyes glowing with excitement.

“*I’m going to enjoy eating you.*” Saying that, Draven left the cave, leaving me in that pitiful state.
