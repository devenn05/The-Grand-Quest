Chapter 1: The Introduction

### **Summer’s POV**

*I am Summer Williams, son of Lucian Williams and Lillian Williams. And, of course, the younger brother of the legendary Reaper Fang. At just ten years old, I am as unremarkable as one could be—or at least, that’s what I believed. That’s what everyone believed.*

*My Essence Manipulation? Painfully average. No special traits. No prodigious talent. Just me, stuck in the endless grind. I trained under ex-Commander Zane for two years—hard training, too. Drills at dawn, lectures that felt like they lasted centuries, sparring sessions that left my arms shaking. And still, nothing extraordinary. My aura control was textbook. My combat instincts? Decent, but nothing that would make anyone turn their head. No elemental affinity, no flashy abilities. In a world where monsters in human form rewrite history, I was just another kid swinging a sword, hoping to matter.*

*But the thing about fate? It doesn’t ask for permission.* 

## Nation Of Peace: Avalon

*Avalon—land of mountains, rivers, and untamed seas. A continent where history breathes through its landscapes, where power is not just held but wielded. Seventeen nations thrive here, each with their own secrets, their own rulers, their own legacies.*

*Among them, Lunaris—the so-called Nation of Peace.*

*Three great noble families stand at its peak—Everhart, Vale, and Williams.*

The Vale family, rulers of Dunford, are war incarnate. Their warriors shape battlefields, their generals dictate history. Strength isn’t just a trait; it’s their birthright.

The Everharts, sovereigns of Lucial, healers and alchemists without equal. Medicine, potions, cures—they hold the line between life and death itself.

And then there’s us. The Williams family. Masters of Essence Manipulation, lords of Riverton, the beating economic heart of Lunaris. We deal in power—both the kind that fuels the body and the kind that fuels nations. While others focus on war or medicine, we wield the very essence of both.

### ***Primordium.***

The force that defines the world. The energy that turns men into legends. Only those who awaken an affinity to Primordium are worthy of standing at the top. In our family, even the guards—no, even the butlers and the servants—carry its blood. Some shape it into raw destruction. Some twist reality itself. Some forge weapons that could split mountains with a single swing.

At the head of it all? My father, Lucian Williams. A man whose name carries weight across Avalon. A tactician, a warrior, a master of Essence Manipulation. His victories in the Lanka War didn’t just earn him a title—they carved our name into history. From Counts to Marquesses, our rise was his doing.

And my mother? Lillian Williams, born of the Vale bloodline. A Material Nexus Manifestor—rare beyond words. A woman who could reshape battlefields, whose abilities defied every expectation placed upon her.

Together, they built something unshakable.

And then there’s my sister, Cel….Celestia Williams.

At just seven years old, she wasn’t just talented—she was terrifying. A prodigy whose potential could shatter expectations, who could stand above warriors twice, even three times her age. She was the kind of child that history remembers.

And me?

I was… nothing.

## **11 YEARS AGO,**

### **Uninvited Guest**

I wasn’t there, obviously. I wasn’t even born yet. But I’ve heard the story enough times to know it by heart. That night—the night I was supposed to be welcomed into the world—something else came knocking first. A **Walking Calamity.**

The estate had been on edge for weeks. At first, it was just whispers—unlucky coincidences stacking up like a rigged deck of cards. Failed business deals. Sudden illness. Tragic accidents. People who should have had decades ahead of them, dropping dead for no reason. At first, everyone chalked it up to bad luck. But too much bad luck stops being luck.

Dad figured it out before anyone else. This wasn’t chance. It wasn’t karma. **It was deliberate.** And when things like this start happening, there’s only one kind of person to blame. A **Reality Influencer.** One of the three rarest Primordium users. The kind of being who doesn’t just manipulate energy or shape matter. No, they go bigger than that. They **rewrite fate.** And someone like that was in our territory, turning reality against us.

So, security tightened. Guards tripled. The estate locked down. Everyone was waiting for the worst to happen. And it did. Not in the dead of night. Not in the middle of a battle. No. She just **walked right in.**

Said her name was **Sasha.** Claimed she was an old friend of my mother’s. Alfred, our head butler—the most paranoid, over-prepared man in existence—didn’t recognize her. He should have turned her away. But he didn’t. Instead, he let her in, sat her down in the hall, and went to tell Mom.

And here’s where things get weird. The moment Mom heard Sasha’s name? She hesitated. That might not sound like much, but my mother isn’t the kind of person who hesitates. Ever. She could have sent her away. She **should** have sent her away. Instead, she said: **"*Bring her in.*"**

Celestia—my older sister—was in the room too. Seven years old at the tim, stronger than most teen warriors, even back then. She didn’t just see Primordium—she could **feel** it, down to its rawest form. And the second Sasha stepped inside? Celestia **screamed.**

Not a startled scream. Not a childish, **I don’t like this person** kind of scream. No. This was terror. Pure, instinctual, **something-is-wrong** terror. Mom froze. Alfred stiffened. And Celestia? She just stood there, shaking, **staring at Sasha like she was looking at bald monk.**

To everyone else, Sasha looked… normal. But Celestia? She could **feel** what no one else could. She didn’t get a chance to warn them. Because in the next second, Sasha moved. Straight for Mom. She wasn’t there to talk. She was there to **kill,** one could feel all that killing intent.

Celestia didn’t think. Didn’t hesitate. She **jumped.** Threw herself between Mom and Sasha, **pushing her back.** And she almost made it. Almost. But just as Sasha was shoved away, her fingers **brushed Celestia’s arm.** Just for a second. 

Then—**Alfred moved.** A single clean strike. Fire flashed. **Sasha’s head hit the ground.** Silence. Celestia swayed. Then collapsed.

That’s when Dad walked in. One look. That’s all he needed. He took in the body, the blood, the way Mom stood frozen and Celestia lay unmoving. And for a moment, he didn’t say a word. Then: **"What happened?"** Alfred told him everything. By the time he finished, everyone thought it was over. The intruder was dead. The threat was gone.

But no one—not Mom, not Alfred, not even Dad—noticed **the touch.** That single moment when Sasha’s fingers met Celestia’s skin. And whatever the hell she did in that instant? **It stayed. It changed everything.**

But about in a week’s time nobody was thinking or talking about Sasha anymore. 

They were celebrating.

Because on that day—1st of April, after a nights of blood and secrets—

**I was born.**
