Chapter 1: Shadows of Tomorrow

### **Summer’s POV**

*I am Summer Williams, son of Lucian Williams and Lillian Williams. And, of course, the younger brother of the legendary Reaper Fang. At just ten years old, I am as unremarkable as one could be—or at least, that’s what I believed. That’s what everyone believed.*

*My Essence Manipulation? Painfully average. No special traits. No prodigious talent. Just me, stuck in the endless grind. I trained under ex-Commander Zane for two years—hard training, too. Drills at dawn, lectures that felt like they lasted centuries, sparring sessions that left my arms shaking. And still, nothing extraordinary. My aura control was textbook. My combat instincts? Decent, but nothing that would make anyone turn their head. No elemental affinity, no flashy abilities. In a world where monsters in human form rewrite history, I was just another kid swinging a sword, hoping to matter.*

*But the thing about fate? It doesn’t ask for permission. You might wonder why I’m not jumping straight into my sad and boring story and instead telling you about my family and everything first. Well, you’ll need to understand that part, so I might as well start now.* 

## **11 YEARS AGO,**

*Avalon—land of mountains, rivers, and untamed seas. A continent where history breathes through its landscapes, where power is not just held but wielded. Seventeen nations thrive here, each with their own secrets, their own rulers, their own legacies.*

*Among them, Lunaris—the so-called Nation of Peace.*

*Three great noble families stand at its peak—Everhart, Vale, and Williams.*

The Vale family, rulers of Dunford, are war incarnate. Their warriors shape battlefields, their generals dictate history. Strength isn’t just a trait; it’s their birthright.

The Everharts, sovereigns of Lucial, healers and alchemists without equal. Medicine, potions, cures—they hold the line between life and death itself.

And then there’s us. The Williams family. Masters of Essence Manipulation, lords of Riverton, the beating economic heart of Lunaris. We deal in power—both the kind that fuels the body and the kind that fuels nations. While others focus on war or medicine, we wield the very essence of existence itself.

*Primordium.*

The force that defines the world. The energy that turns men into legends. Only those who awaken an affinity to Primordium are worthy of standing at the top. In our family, even the servants—no, even the butlers and the guards—carry its blood. Some shape it into raw destruction. Some twist reality itself. Some forge weapons that could split mountains with a single swing.

At the head of it all? My father, Lucian Williams. A man whose name carries weight across Avalon. A tactician, a warrior, a master of Essence Manipulation. His victories in the Lanka War didn’t just earn him a title—they carved our name into history. From Counts to Marquesses, our rise was his doing.

And my mother? Lillian Williams, born of the Vale bloodline. A Material Nexus Manifestor—rare beyond words. A woman who could reshape battlefields, whose abilities defied every expectation placed upon her.

Together, they built something unshakable.

And then there’s my sister, Celestia Williams.

At just seven years old, she wasn’t just talented—she was terrifying. A prodigy whose potential could shatter expectations, who could stand above warriors twice, even three times her age. She was the kind of child that history remembers.

And me?

I was… nothing.

Or at least, that’s what I thought.

Because fate? Fate had other plans.

### **Uninvited Guest**

I wasn’t there, obviously. I wasn’t even born yet. But I’ve heard the story enough times to know it by heart. That night—the night I was supposed to be welcomed into the world—something else came knocking first. A **Walking Calamity.**

The estate had been on edge for weeks. At first, it was just whispers—unlucky coincidences stacking up like a rigged deck of cards. Failed business deals. Sudden illness. Tragic accidents. People who should have had decades ahead of them, dropping dead for no reason. At first, everyone chalked it up to bad luck. But too much bad luck stops being luck.

Dad figured it out before anyone else. This wasn’t chance. It wasn’t karma. **It was deliberate.** And when things like this start happening, there’s only one kind of person to blame. A **Reality Influencer.** One of the three rarest Primordium users. The kind of being who doesn’t just manipulate energy or shape matter. No, they go bigger than that. They **rewrite fate.** And someone like that was in our territory, turning reality against us.

So, security tightened. Guards tripled. The estate locked down. Everyone was waiting for the worst to happen. And it did. Not in the dead of night. Not in the middle of a battle. No. She just **walked right in.**

Said her name was **Sasha.** Claimed she was an old friend of my mother’s. Alfred, our head butler—the most paranoid, over-prepared man in existence—didn’t recognize her. He should have turned her away. But he didn’t. Instead, he let her in, sat her down in the hall, and went to tell Mom.

And here’s where things get weird. The moment Mom heard Sasha’s name? She hesitated. That might not sound like much, but my mother isn’t the kind of person who hesitates. Ever. She could have sent her away. She **should** have sent her away. Instead, she said: **"Bring her in."**

Celestia—my older sister—was in the room too. Seven years old at the time. A prodigy. Stronger than most trained warriors, even back then. She didn’t just see Primordium—she could **feel** it, down to its rawest form. And the second Sasha stepped inside? Celestia **screamed.**

Not a startled scream. Not a childish, **I don’t like this person** kind of scream. No. This was terror. Pure, instinctual, **something-is-wrong** terror. Mom froze. Alfred stiffened. And Celestia? She just stood there, shaking, **staring at Sasha like she was looking at death itself.**

To everyone else, Sasha looked… normal. But Celestia? She could **feel** what no one else could. She didn’t get a chance to warn them. Because in the next second, Sasha moved. Straight for Mom. She wasn’t there to talk. She was there to **kill.**

Celestia didn’t think. Didn’t hesitate. She **jumped.** Threw herself between Mom and Sasha, **pushing her back.** And she almost made it. Almost. But just as Sasha was shoved away, her fingertips **brushed Celestia’s arm.** Just for a second. And that second was **too long.**

Then—**Alfred moved.** A single clean strike. Fire flashed. **Sasha’s head hit the ground.** Silence. Celestia swayed. Then collapsed.

That’s when Dad walked in. One look. That’s all he needed. He took in the body, the blood, the way Mom stood frozen and Celestia lay unmoving. And for a moment, he didn’t say a word. Then: **"What happened?"** Alfred told him everything. By the time he finished, everyone thought it was over. The intruder was dead. The threat was gone.

But no one—not Mom, not Alfred, not even Dad—noticed **the touch.** That single moment when Sasha’s fingers met Celestia’s skin. And whatever the hell she did in that instant? **It stayed. It changed everything.**

### **A Week Later…**

Celestia barely slept that week. She never talked about what happened. Never mentioned what she felt when Sasha touched her. But she was different. Quieter. Uneasy. Like something was **lingering.** Then, one day, she just… snapped back to normal. Or at least, that’s what everyone **thought.**

Because exactly a week later, nobody was thinking about Sasha anymore. They were celebrating.

Because on that day—1st of April, after a nights of blood and secrets—

**I was born.**

## Vale & Williams Get Together

You know how summer feels, right? Warm. Wild. Full of life. My parents must’ve thought the same thing when they named me. Maybe they believed I’d bring the same kind of energy into their lives. Maybe they just liked the way it sounded. Either way, **Baby Summer had arrived.**

April 1st—the day the news spread like wildfire. Not just in our household, but all across Lunaris. My dad, Lucian Williams, the kind of man who **doesn’t do things halfway,** personally picked my name. **Summer.** A name meant to stand for strength, warmth, and a future so bright it could outshine the sun.

And, of course, with a name like that, my arrival couldn’t be some quiet little affair. No. **It had to be legendary.**

A grand naming ceremony was planned, the kind that made a statement. Not just a party, but a declaration—**"Here he is. The next heir of the Williams family. Remember the name."** Invitations were sent out to marquises, counts from neighboring nations, Dad’s war comrades, Mom’s closest friends, and, naturally, the Vales and Everharts—our fellow ruling families of Lunaris. This wasn’t just about welcoming me into the world. **It was about power. Prestige. Making sure everyone knew exactly where we stood.**

The Vale family arrived first, days ahead of the main event. Cedric Vale, their patriarch, brought his wife, Elara, and their daughters, **Serina and Stephanie.** Their son, Luke, was absent, probably off doing something important—though knowing Luke, that could’ve meant anything from a high-stakes mission to a mid-afternoon nap.

Now, here’s the thing—Mom was originally a Vale. **Same bloodline. Same legacy.** So our families weren’t just allies, we were bound by tradition, by history. And that meant Celestia and Stephanie had been attached at the hip since childhood. **Best friends. Partners in crime. Unstoppable when together.**

Serina, though? **Total opposite.** Quiet. Reserved. The kind of person who preferred the sidelines over the spotlight. She never really joined in, just observed, blending into the background while her sister and Celestia ran wild.

The night before the big celebration, both families gathered for a private dinner—**one last moment of calm before the storm of nobility, politics, and endless formalities.** Strengthening ties, sharing laughter, exchanging stories. It was all about keeping up appearances, about unity. About showing the world that the Williams and Vale legacies stood together.

### **Reception**

The day of the grand celebration finally arrived, and with it came a flood of guests—**each one a walking symbol of power and prestige.** One by one, they arrived, their mere presence a reminder of just how far the Williams family’s influence reached.

Orion Everhart, head of the Everhart family, made his entrance with his two sons in tow, their every step **oozing nobility.** Representatives from the Norwood family, long-time allies of my father, arrived soon after. Then came the marquises, the high-ranking nobles, and the distinguished families of Lunaris—all here to witness the official introduction of **Baby Summer.**

But the one guest who stood out from the rest? **Zane.** Former Lord Commander of Avalon. A legend in his own right. **And more importantly—one of my father’s most trusted friends.** He hadn’t just come for the party. No, Dad had personally invited him for a private discussion once all the pleasantries were over.

The ceremony itself went off without a hitch. **“Summer.”** My name echoed through the grand halls, repeated by nobles, warriors, scholars—each one speaking it with admiration, recognition. Laughter filled the air, drinks flowed endlessly, and conversation sparked in every corner of the estate.

By the time the festivities wrapped up, the guests began their slow departure. One after another, they bid their farewells, their voices laced with congratulations and well wishes. The Vale family had to leave earlier than expected—**urgent matters back home,** or so they claimed. Their absence was noticeable, but no one questioned it. **Politics worked in its own quiet, complicated ways.**

Later that evening, **after the castle had settled into a quieter hum,** my family shared an intimate dinner, with Zane as our honored guest. The conversation stretched late into the night, lingering over fine meals and aged wine. There was laughter, yes, but also an underlying tension—**the kind that hinted at words left unsaid.**

Once the gathering came to an end, Mom carried me to her chambers, Celestia trailing closely behind. The night outside was calm, but inside the castle? **Something was brewing.**

In the dim glow of his study, my father sat across from Zane, the flickering lanterns casting long shadows on the walls. The remnants of their evening meal rested on the table between them, neither of them paying it much attention.

Zane leaned forward, curiosity sharp in his eyes. **“*Lucian, what matter requires my attention?*”**

Dad met his gaze, unreadable as always. **“*I've been meaning to ask you for a favor. But let’s save that for tomorrow, during our outing. For now, get some rest. We have a long day ahead.*”**

There was something unspoken in his tone—**serious, deliberate.** A conversation for another time, another place.

Zane, despite his curiosity, didn’t push. He simply nodded, understanding the weight behind my father’s words.

Alfred, ever the perfect butler, stepped forward right on cue. **“*Allow me to escort you to your quarters, Lord Zane.*”**

And just like that, the conversation ended. **For now.**

### Zane’s Promise

Morning light spilled over the Williams estate, casting long golden rays as Lucian and Zane stepped onto the stone pathways. Their movements were unhurried, but there was a weight to them—**the kind only carried by men who had fought and bled on too many battlefields.**

Zane, never one for patience, finally glanced over. **"***So, what is it you wanted from me?***"**

Lucian smirked. **"***Before that, how about a spar?***"**

Zane sighed, shaking his head, but there was no real protest. **He should’ve known.** Within minutes, word spread like wildfire—Lucian Williams, the formidable Patriarch, was about to spar against Zane, the legendary former Lord Commander of Avalon. Servants whispered, guards abandoned their posts, and even the most seasoned warriors made their way to the training grounds.

This wasn’t just any duel. **This was a clash between titans.**

Lucian and Zane stood at the center of the training ring, their gazes locked. They were more than just master swordsmen—**they were Essence Manipulators, warriors who bent the very fabric of energy to their will.**

Zane—one of the top twenty Essence Manipulators in all of Avalon. A warrior whose battlefield instincts were **flawless,** his combat style a perfect balance of **brutal strength and precise execution.**

Lucian—a strategist without equal. His essence manipulation wasn’t about raw power but **unparalleled control.** His defensive mastery was **legendary,** his movements calculated to perfection.

The crowd held its breath.

Lucian’s voice was calm, controlled. **"***Begin.***"**

**The ground cracked beneath them.**

In an instant, they **vanished.**

Then—**steel met steel.**

The clash rang out like a thunderstrike, sparks flying as their blades locked. **Zane struck first—fast, precise, ruthless.** But Lucian? He was already ahead of him, each parry flowing like water, deflecting every attack with perfect efficiency. Even as he defended, his aura began to build.

Then—**he disappeared.**

A fraction of a second later, he was everywhere.

Lucian’s speed doubled. Then tripled. **Then surged tenfold.**

His movements became a blur, his attacks hitting from impossible angles. Each strike carried the weight of a hurricane, the force of an avalanche. **The air itself trembled under the sheer energy radiating from him.**

Zane gritted his teeth. **Monstrous.**

He had fought countless warriors, but this? This was different. **Every block sent shockwaves through his arms.** He had no openings—**Lucian wasn’t just attacking. He was dissecting him.**

The battle could have ended there—Lucian could have infused his strikes with elemental energy and overwhelmed Zane in an instant. But this wasn’t a war. **It was a test. A reminder. A challenge.**

Zane knew it too.

So—he shifted.

Unlike Lucian, who spread his essence evenly, Zane did something far more dangerous. **He funneled everything into his sword.**

The air turned suffocatingly heavy.

Onlookers felt their knees buckle as a wave of **pure killing intent** crashed over the battlefield.

Lucian exhaled, his instincts flaring. **He recognized this.** He had seen it before. And if he didn’t release his own aura now, he wouldn’t evade in time.

Then—**Zane vanished.**

He didn’t just move fast. **He ceased to exist for a fraction of a second.**

And when he reappeared—**he was already within striking distance.**

Lucian barely had time to react.

Zane’s blade, carrying the full weight of his essence, **descended like divine judgment.**

**A deafening silence.**

Then—

**"***I lose.***"**

Lucian’s voice cut through the air.

The crowd froze.

Zane’s sword had stopped **mere millimeters from Lucian’s throat.** Had the strike landed, it would have been over.

Slowly, Zane exhaled, letting his essence dissipate. A grin tugged at his lips. **"S***till sharp as ever, Lucian.***"**

Lucian smirked, shaking his head. **"***You always did fight recklessly. If that missed, you'd have been wide open.***"**

The fight had ended.

But the message was clear.

**Zane was still a monster.**

Zane, still catching his breath, shot my father an exasperated look. *"So are you finally going to tell me what this is all about now?"* he demanded, rolling his shoulders as he sheathed his blade.

My father, his grin laced with mischief, leaned forward slightly. *"I want you to train my son in the coming years. I want you to be his mentor—his teacher."*

Zane raised an eyebrow, clearly caught off guard. *"Me? Why? Don’t tell me you’re doubting your own ability. You’re more than capable of training him yourself, Lucian."*

My father let out a low chuckle. *"Oh, I know I am. But you? You’re better. You always have been. That spar just proved it yet again. I don’t want my son to settle for ‘good enough.’ I want him to learn from the very best. So, Zane, I’m asking you—take my child as your pupil."*

Zane exhaled sharply, crossing his arms as he considered the request. His expression was unreadable, his silence stretching just long enough for my father to notice. Then, with a sigh, Zane finally spoke. *"Let’s not get ahead of ourselves. The boy hasn’t even grown a tooth, much less manifested his Primordium yet. When he does, we’ll talk."*

My father smirked, confidence radiating from him. *"Fine. We’ll wait. But when the time comes, you’d better be ready—because my son is going to surprise you. He’ll be the greatest student you’ve ever had."*

Zane shook his head, a small laugh escaping him. The tension between them eased, replaced by the warmth of old camaraderie. With that, they continued their outing, reminiscing about past battles, shared victories, and the uncertain future that lay ahead.

The next day, as Zane was preparing to depart from my father’s domain and return to the capital, he caught sight of my sister in the training grounds, practicing her essence manipulation. She was focused, her small hands trembling slightly as she attempted to maintain the thin layer of energy coating her arms. Though unstable, the fact that she could manifest essence at such a young age was nothing short of astonishing.

Zane halted in his tracks, watching intently as she took a deep breath and tried again, this time holding the coating for a few seconds longer. A flicker of genuine surprise crossed his face before he turned to my father.

*"You know, Lucian, why didn’t you ask me to train her too?"* He gestured toward Celestia. *"She’s got potential. Even a low-level essence coating at her age is unheard of. With the right training, she could become something truly exceptional."*

Zane crossed his arms, considering for a moment before smirking. *"You know what? Forget waiting for you to ask—I’ll train her too."*

My father took a moment before responding, his gaze distant. *"I know, Zane. I know better than anyone how much potential she has—how incredible she could become. But I'm also afraid."* He exhaled, his expression softening. *"I don’t want her to be forced down a path of hardship. I want her to grow at her own pace, to enjoy her childhood without the weight of expectations crushing her. She’ll find her own way in time, and when she’s ready... she’ll decide for herself. I know it might seem contradictory—I asked you to train Summer, yet I hesitate when it comes to Celestia. But Summer... he'll have responsibilities in the future, a duty he cannot avoid. And Celestia... even though she, too, will have her own burdens, I want to give her something different—a peaceful life, at least for now."*

Zane exhaled in mild frustration but chose not to press the matter further. He knew my father well enough to understand that once his mind was set, there was little anyone could do to change it. With a final glance at Celestia—who remained focused on her practice, completely unaware of their conversation—he let out a small sigh.

*"You're too soft when it comes to her,"* Zane muttered, more to himself than to my father.

My father simply chuckled, shaking his head. *"Perhaps. But that's my choice to make."*

Zane gave a small smirk before turning on his heel. As he made his way toward the gates, the weight of their conversation lingered between them. My father walked beside him in silence, neither feeling the need to say much more. When they reached the castle gates, Zane mounted his horse, gripping the reins as he cast one last look at his old friend.

*"I'll hold you to your word, Lucian. When the time comes, don't let your fears hold her back."*

My father met his gaze, his expression unreadable. *"I won’t."*

With that, Zane gave a small nod and spurred his horse forward, the sound of hooves fading as he disappeared down the road. My father remained at the gates, watching until his friend was out of sight before turning back toward the castle, his thoughts lingering on the uncertain future ahead.

# **Dunford Outing**

Two years had passed in a blur. I had gone from barely crawling to walking—then running—and before anyone knew it, I was talking in full sentences. The estate was never quiet anymore, filled with my laughter, my attempts at sneaking away from the maids, and my endless questions. But for all the things I learned, there was one thing that still hadn’t happened. My Primordium hadn’t awakened.

Celestia, on the other hand, had just turned nine, and she was already powerful. Strong in a way that made people stare. She could do things no other child her age could, and everyone knew it. Even Father. Even the knights. They tried not to compare us, but they didn’t have to—I could see it.

Outside the estate, the world was shifting. The Black Veil Incident had left Lunaris uneasy, and Father had been in constant meetings with Lord Cedric Vale. He was preparing to travel to Dunford to handle the situation. Celestia was going with him.

When news of Celestia’s visit reached Stephanie, her excitement was instant. It had been far too long since they last saw each other, and the thought of spending time together again filled her with anticipation.

She was learning about politics, about noble alliances and power. Father was teaching her himself, guiding her through things that I didn’t fully understand. She was meant for it, I suppose.

On the day they left, the carriage stood waiting, guarded by knights. Father spoke to Celestia as they climbed in, his voice steady, teaching even now. She listened, but her gaze was distant.

I stood by the entrance, watching the carriage move down the road until it was gone.

### **Arrival in Dunford**

As their carriage rolled past Dunford’s towering gates, Celestia peered out, taking in the sight of the city. Unlike Riverton, a hub of commerce, Dunford was a stronghold, built for war and strategy. Soldiers patrolled the streets, their disciplined presence a reflection of the Vale family's influence. Even the air felt different here—charged with the unspoken weight of battle-hardened history.

When they finally arrived at the Vale Mansion, they were greeted by Cedric and his family. Standing beside him, Stephanie practically bounced on her feet, her excitement barely contained.

The moment Celestia stepped down from the carriage, Stephanie rushed forward and hugged her.

"*I've missed you so much!*" she beamed. "*We have so much to catch up on!*"

Celestia chuckled at her enthusiasm. *"You act like it’s been years!"*

"*It feels like it!*" Stephanie huffed dramatically, then grabbed Celestia’s wrist. "*Come on, let’s go! I’ll show you everything new in Dunford!"*

That afternoon, the two wandered through the bustling market district, weaving between vendors calling out their wares. The streets were filled with the rich aroma of roasted meat, fresh bread, and exotic spices. Musicians played lively tunes in the background, and children dashed about, playing games between merchant stalls.

Yet, despite the lively atmosphere, Celestia seemed distant.

Noticing this, Stephanie nudged her. "*What’s wrong, Celi? You don’t seem to be having fun.*"

Snapping out of her thoughts, Celestia hesitated before replying, her voice quieter than before. "*It’s nothing… I’m happy we're doing this, really. But for the past month, I’ve been struggling with my training.*" She exhaled, her fingers clenching slightly.

Stephanie tilted her head. "*Struggling? You? That’s a first*," she teased, but when Celestia didn’t respond with her usual smirk, her playful expression shifted to concern.

Celestia frowned slightly, glancing down at her palm. "*I can coat my body with my elemental aura, but it’s still too weak. And no matter how much I try, I can’t extend it to objects. I’ve trained every day, tested every method, and still... nothing. It should be simple by now, but I feel like I'm stuck, like something is missing.*"

She let out a frustrated sigh before shaking her head, forcing a small smile. "*Never mind that. I’ll figure it out later. For now, let’s go eat pancakes.*"

Stephanie watched her for a moment, then broke into a grin. "*Celi, you’re the strongest friend I have! Even my big brother Luke is weaker than you." She nudged Celestia playfully. "Don’t stress about it—you’ll get there. You always do! And when you do, you’ll probably master it so well that no one will be able to keep up. So stop worrying!*"

Celestia blinked at her before chuckling softly. "*You really think so?*"

Stephanie rolled her eyes. *"Of course! I wouldn’t lie to you. Now, let’s go! I’m starving*!" She grabbed Celestia’s wrist and tugged her forward.

For a moment, Celestia let herself be pulled along, the warmth of her friend’s words pushing away the weight of her frustrations. Maybe she was overthinking it. Maybe, just maybe, she would figure it out—just like she always had.

And for now, pancakes sounded like a pretty good distraction.

Meanwhile, in the grand hall of Vale’s castle, Lucian and Cedric sat across from each other, their discussion stretching into its third hour. The atmosphere was tense, the gravity of their words evident in their expressions. Alfred stood nearby, his sharp gaze observing every detail, while Vale’s personal swordsman remained stationed at the entrance, a silent guardian to the high-stakes conversation.

The Black Veil Incident had shaken the entire nation. Reports of abandoned villages, livestock slaughtered, and entire populations vanishing without a trace had unsettled even the most hardened leaders. Cedric exhaled, his fingers tapping lightly against the armrest of his chair. “The more we investigate, the less we understand. My scouts returned with fragmented reports—whispers in the dark, shadows moving unnaturally. None of it makes sense. Some of them didn’t even made it back. A Black rose is the only link we have.”

Lucian’s eyes darkened. “*If this continues, fear will consume the people before the enemy even reveals itself. We need answers, Cedric. And we need them soon.*”

A heavy silence filled the room. Neither of them had an answer—only the certainty that whatever lurked in the darkness was far from ordinary.

Breaking the tense silence, Cedric leaned back with a knowing smirk. "*So, what’s the deal with Celestia? Not only has she manifested one of the rarest elements, but her growth rate is downright monstrous. At this pace, your daughter might just surpass you before she even reaches her twenties.*"

Lucian exhaled slowly, his fingers tapping rhythmically against the armrest. His gaze drifted toward the grand windows, where the evening light filtered through. A flicker of emotion crossed his face—pride, concern, and something deeper. "*That’s exactly what worries me,*" he muttered, his voice carrying an unspoken weight.

Cedric raised an eyebrow. "*Worries you? That should be a damn blessing, Lucian. A prodigy like her—*"

Lucian cut him off with a slight shake of his head. "*Prodigies attract attention. The kind of attention I don't want on my daughter. You and I both know that talent alone isn’t always a gift—it’s a beacon, and not everyone who takes notice has good intentions.*" His voice was steady, but Cedric could hear the edge in it.

A brief silence settled between them before Lucian sighed, running a hand through his hair. "*Talk about something else.*"

Cedric chuckled but didn’t push further, sensing Lucian wasn’t ready to dwell on the topic. Instead, he shifted gears, his tone turning more thoughtful. "*I’m sending Stephanie and Serina to the capital soon. A close friend of mine will be mentoring them—a renowned Archmage Manifestor. It’s a year-long expedition, it’ll surely sharpen their abilities and give them exposure to the world beyond our domains.*" He paused for a moment before adding, "*If you truly want Celestia to grow stronger, why not let her go too? She’ll gain experience, face new challenges, and refine her skills under someone I trust completely.*"

Lucian’s expression remained neutral, but his eyes narrowed slightly. "*A Manifestor training an Essence Manipulator?*" he though in his mind and was about to question that’s when Cedric caught on to the hesitation and leaned forward with a sly grin. "*I know what you’re thinking—how could a Manifestor possibly help someone like Celestia?*" His voice dipped slightly, laced with amusement. "*Because she’s not just a Manifestor. She’s a dual-nexus user*."

Lucian’s fingers stopped drumming against the armrest, his gaze sharpening. "*A dual-nexus user? Are you talking about Elysia Wells?*", Cedric gave a subtle nod, his expression unreadable. The weight of that revelation hung between them, and for the first time in their conversation, Cedric saw something new in Lucian’s eyes—interest.  After a moment of silence, he spoke, his voice measured. “*Let me speak with Celestia and Lillian first. I need to hear their thoughts before making a decision.*”

Dual Nexus User—someone capable of wielding two out of the three Primordium. They were rare, almost mythical, with only a handful known across the entire kingdom of Avalon. That one of them—an Archmage, no less—would be teaching his daughter was no small matter. Lucian felt a storm of emotions rise within him. Excitement, because this was an unparalleled opportunity. Worry, because the road ahead would not be easy. Happiness, because Celestia was growing stronger. And sadness... because he knew this was a path where she’ll pace a fair share of  difficulties, pain and struggle.

At dawn, Lucian and Celestia prepared to depart for Riverton. Celestia and Stephanie shared their goodbyes, their usual playful banter tinged with something softer—an unspoken understanding that things were about to change. Stephanie, following Cedric’s orders, refrained from mentioning her upcoming expedition. If Lucian refused the offer, Celestia’s stubbornness would undoubtedly create trouble.

As they rode away from Dunford, Celestia cast one last glance back at the towering walls of the Vale estate, her thoughts lingering on her friend. The road back to Riverton stretched before them, but for Celestia, it felt like something had shifted—like she was stepping toward something new, even if she didn’t yet know what.

## Departure of Celestia

 

The next day, Father sat with Mother in their private chamber, sunlight spilling through the windows. He must’ve expected her to be against it because he looked kind of tense, but she just listened. No interrupting, no arguing—just sitting there, thinking.

Then, finally, she let out a quiet sigh. "*She’s strong, Lucian. Maybe even stronger than we realize.*" She tapped her fingers against the table, her face unreadable. "*I know you want to protect her. I do too. But we can’t shelter her forever.*"

Father ran a hand through his hair, looking frustrated. "*I just—*" He hesitated, which wasn’t like him. "*I don’t want her to go through what we did.*"

Mother reached over, resting her hand on his. "*I know,*" she said softly. "*But you’ve always said Celestia has fire in her heart. If we hold her back, we’ll only smother it. This is her chance to grow.*"

Father frowned, clearly not liking it. But in the end, he just sighed and nodded. "*Then it’s decided.*"

Later that evening, Celestia was called into the grand hall. Both of them were already there, sitting in silence, looking at her with unreadable expressions. The whole atmosphere was heavy, like something big was about to happen.

"*I'll get straight to the point, Cel,*" Father finally said, his voice calm but firm. "*You already know how much potential you have. Your affinity hasn’t developed yet, but your aura control is ahead of your peers.*" He paused, tapping his fingers on the armrest. "*I’ve found a teacher for you. Not me—someone Cedric Vale arranged. She’s a dual nexus user, and she’ll be leaving for the capital next week with his daughters. He asked if you want to go with them.*"

Then, he leaned forward slightly, his golden eyes sharp.

"*I don’t want you to go.*"

Celestia’s breath caught for a second, but Father wasn’t done.

"*I’ve always wanted to give you a life without struggles. To keep you happy, safe, away from the burdens this path brings. Because make no mistake, Cel—this road is full of hardship and pain. And if I can shield you from that, I will.*"

His voice wavered, just for a second. Then he took a slow breath and steadied himself.

"*But I also know you,*" he continued. "*Since you were little, you’ve been relentless—always chasing strength, always pushing past your limits. And no matter how much I want to hold you back, I know that fire inside you won’t let you stay still.*"

He rubbed his temples, exhaling, before meeting her gaze again.

"*So I’ll ask this only once. Do you want to go?* It’s an incredible opportunity, but I won’t lie to you—it won’t be easy."

Celestia was quiet for a moment. Then she smiled, that spark in her eyes—the one that always meant trouble—lighting up. "*I’ll think about it and tell you tomorrow, Daddy.*"

Her voice was playful, but I could tell she had already decided.

"*I know you worry too much,*" she added, stretching her arms dramatically. "*But I don’t want to be a weak, boring sister to Summer—I want to be a cool one!*"

*You’re already cool as a cucumber, Celi. Why’d you have to do that?*" anyways this won’t change anything,

Father shook his head, a quiet chuckle escaping him. "*You’re already cool, Cel,*" he muttered.

"*Still,*" she grinned, "*I’ll take the night to decide. No rush, right?*"

But she wasn’t fooling anyone.

The next morning, before the sun was even fully up, she marched straight into Father’s study.

"*I’m going,*" she announced, all confidence.

Father barely reacted, like he already knew. Which, knowing him, he probably did. He just leaned back in his chair with a small sigh. "*I figured as much,*" he said, amused. "*I sent word to Cedric last night.*"

Celestia blinked, surprised for half a second, before smirking. "*You really do know me too well, huh?*"

Father chuckled. "*Better than you think.*"

When Stephanie got the news, she was *way* too excited, practically bouncing in place. "*Finally! She’s coming with us!*" she cheered, clapping her hands together.

She had been hoping Celestia would join them, but with how protective Father was, it wasn’t a sure thing. Now that it was, she couldn’t wait.

Meanwhile, Lord Cedric had already started planning. He had official business in the capital anyway, so he’d be traveling with them. "*Might as well make use of the trip,*" he muttered, flipping through papers. But something about his expression said he knew this journey was going to be more than just business.

### **Goodbye, Before the Storm**

The week passed in a blur, a strange mix of excitement and an unspoken sadness that settled over the estate like morning mist. There was something different in the air, something heavy. Even I could feel it, though I was too young to understand why.

Celestia was everywhere, darting from room to room like a gust of wind, making last-minute requests, checking her things over and over. She acted like she had everything under control, but I could feel the nervous energy buzzing beneath her skin. It wasn’t fear—Celestia never got scared. It was something else. Something even I didn’t have words for yet.

The estate itself felt... off. Servants moved with urgency, Alfred, our butler, stood a little too still, his usual sharp posture softened by something I couldn’t quite name. He watched Celestia closely, his gloved hands tightening behind his back.

“Do take care, young mistress,” he said at one point, his voice softer than I’d ever heard it.

Celestia only grinned. “Of course, Alfred. Don’t get all sentimental on me now.”

Even I could tell it was an act.

Lillian—Mother—had made a decision without telling Celestia. She wasn’t going alone. A woman named Lily had been assigned to travel with her. To everyone else, she was just a maid, but I had heard Mother whisper to Father late at night. She was more than that. She was strong, a Primordium user. A protector.

Even Celestia, for all her excitement, noticed the way Mother’s gaze lingered on Lily. She didn’t ask, though. Maybe she already knew.

And then, finally, the moment arrived.

The grand doors of the estate stood open, the morning air crisp and cool. The carriage waited outside, sleek and black with silver engravings, horses that looked like they came from a storybook standing harnessed at the front. Their breath misted in the air, their silver-tipped manes catching the sunlight. It looked important. It looked like it belonged to someone who was leaving for something great.

Not long after, another carriage rolled up, and two figures stepped out.

Stephanie practically exploded from it. “Celestiaaa!” she squealed, running forward with a grin so wide it looked like her face might split. “You’re finally coming!”

Serina followed behind at a more measured pace. She didn’t say much, but I caught the flicker of something in her eyes.

Cedric arrived soon after, exchanging a look with Father. A silent conversation passed between them. One only men like them could understand.

As the last of the luggage was loaded, something in the air shifted. The excitement, the flurry of movement—it all slowed.

Celestia turned to Father.

He stood there, looking at her, and I saw something I’d never seen before. His golden eyes, always so unreadable, were filled with something raw. Something heavy. Then, before I could even process it, he pulled her into his arms.

Celestia froze, caught off guard. Father wasn’t like this. He was warm in his own way, but he didn’t do things like this.

His embrace was firm, like he was memorizing the shape of her. Like he was trying to hold onto something already slipping away. “Stay safe, Cel,” he murmured, his voice steadier than it should’ve been. “No matter where you are, if you need me—just send word. I’ll be there.”

Celestia swallowed hard. “I’ll be fine, Daddy.”

He pulled back just enough to look at her, his hands still gripping her shoulders. “You don’t know that,” he said, a breath of a chuckle escaping him, but there was no humor in it. “That’s what makes this so damn hard.”

Then Mother stepped forward. She was softer than Father, but her strength was just as undeniable. She tucked a stray lock of Celestia’s hair behind her ear, her fingers lingering for just a moment longer than necessary. “Take care of yourself, my love,” she said gently. “Be strong, but don’t forget to be kind. Power means nothing if you lose sight of who you are.”

Celestia nodded, blinking rapidly.

And then she turned to me.

I didn’t understand why everyone was acting like this. Why Father looked like he was trying to hold the whole world together with just his hands. Why Mother’s voice trembled even though she tried to hide it. Why Celestia looked like she wanted to cry but refused to let herself.

To me, it was simple. My big sister was going on a trip. She’d be back soon.

I giggled as she crouched down and pressed a soft kiss to my forehead, her fingers brushing through my hair. “I’ll be back before you know it, baby Summer,” she whispered.

She lied.

She didn’t mean to. She truly believed it.

None of us knew the truth.

This was the last time Celestia and I would ever see each other.

Destiny had other plans.

She stood, her gaze sweeping over us all one last time. Then, without another word, she turned and climbed into the carriage.

The wheels began to move. The horses’ hooves clattered against the stone path. Slowly, the carriage rolled forward, carrying her away from us, from home, from everything familiar.

Celestia turned back, her eyes locking onto mine as I waved, grinning, oblivious.

I didn’t know.

I didn’t know that sometimes, destiny is cruel.

The carriage disappeared into the horizon.

And just like that… she was gone.
