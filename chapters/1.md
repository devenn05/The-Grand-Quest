### **Summer’s POV**

***Summer, lying on the bed—missing an arm and a leg, silent and still.***

*I am Summer Williams, son of Lucian Williams and Lillian Williams. And, of course, the younger brother of the Reaper Fang. At just fourteen years old, I am as unremarkable as one could be—or at least, that’s what I believed. That’s what everyone believed.*

*My Essence Manipulation? Painfully average. No special traits. No prodigious talent. Just me, stuck in the endless grind. I trained under ex-Commander Zane for two years—hard training, too. Drills at dawn, lectures that felt like they lasted centuries, sparring sessions that left my arms shaking. And still, nothing extraordinary. My aura control was textbook. My combat instincts? Decent, but nothing that would make anyone turn their head. No elemental affinity, no flashy abilities. In a world where monsters in human form rewrite history, I was just another kid swinging a sword, hoping to matter.*

*But the thing about fate? It doesn’t ask for permission.* 

## Nation Of Peace: Lunaris

*One of the Five Continent, Avalon—land of mountains, rivers, and untamed seas. A continent where history breathes through the landscape, where power is not just held, but wielded. Seventeen nations thrive here, each with their own secrets, rulers, and legacies.*

Alongside Humans—the ever-adaptive, ambition-driven race—exist ten widely known sentient species. There have been rumors of other sentient species as well, but nothing confirmed—only scattered sightings and legends without solid proof But Avalon is the homeland of Humans and Elves, though Beastfolk and Werewolves also dwell in parts of its wild territories.

Of the rest, one stands out—**Lunaris**. A purely human nation often called *The Nation of Peace*, known for diplomacy, healing arts, and its neutral stance in intercontinental conflicts.

*Three great noble families stand at its peak—Everhart, Vale, and Williams.*

The Vale family, rulers of Dunford, are war incarnate. Their warriors shape battlefields, their generals dictate history. Strength isn’t just a trait; it’s their birthright.

The Everharts, sovereigns of Lucial, healers and alchemists without equal. Medicine, potions, cures—they hold the line between life and death itself.

And then there’s us. The Williams family, lords of Riverton, the beating economic heart of Lunaris. We deal in power—both the kind that fuels the body and the kind that fuels nations. While others focus on war or medicine, we wield the very essence of both.

### ***Primordium.***

*Primordium—the force that shapes our world. The energy that turns ordinary men into legends. But not everyone is blessed with it. In truth, only one in hundred people ever awaken an affinity for Primordium at all.*

Among those who awaken it, most fall into one of two paths. The **Manifestors**, who unleash raw energy and shape it however they desire—and the **Essence Manipulators**, who channel their power inward or outward, enhancing their bodies, senses, or even nature itself. Both paths are fundamentally rooted in one's own Essence.

But then, there's the third kind. The rarest of them all. **Reality Influencers**. One in a thousand among Primordium users—rare enough that even among the gifted, they’re spoken of more in stories than in person. These are the ones who bend the rules of the world itself, rewriting the laws of what can or can’t be done.

**Williams Family**

At the head of it all? My father, Lucian Williams. A man whose name carries weight across Avalon. A tactician, a warrior, a master of Essence Manipulation. His victories in the Wars across nations didn’t just earn him a title—they carved our name into history. From Counts to Marquesses, our rise was his doing.

And my mother? Lillian Williams, born of the Vale bloodline. A Manifestor—rare beyond words. A woman whose abilities defied every expectation placed upon her.

Together, they built something unshakable.

And then there’s my sister, Cel….Celestia Williams.

At just the age of seven, she managed to manipulate Essence voluntarily, She wasn’t just talented—she was terrifying. A prodigy whose potential could shatter expectations, who could stand above warriors twice, even three times her age. She was the kind of child that history remembers.

And me?

I was… nothing. I WAS….

---

*Before I tell you how I ended up like this—crippled, with one leg and one arm gone—I need to give you some context. To understand any of it, we have to go back to when it all truly began… when I was born. Thirteen… no, fourteen years ago.*

## **My Origin**

You know how summer feels, right? Warm. Wild. Full of life. My parents must’ve thought the same thing when they named me. Maybe they believed I’d bring the same kind of energy into their lives. Maybe they just liked the way it sounded. Either way, Baby Summer had arrived.

April 1st—the day the news spread like wildfire. Not just in our household, but all across Lunaris. My dad, Lucian Williams, the kind of man who doesn’t do things halfway**,** personally picked my name. **Summer.** A name meant to stand for strength, warmth, and a future so bright it could outshine the sun.

And, of course, with a name like that, my arrival couldn’t be some quiet little affair. No. It had to be legendary.

A grand naming ceremony was planned, the kind that made a statement. Not just a party, but a declaration—**"**Here he is. The next heir of the Williams family. Remember the name.**"** Invitations were sent out to marquises, counts from neighboring nations, Dad’s war comrades, Mom’s closest friends, and, naturally, the Vales and Everharts—our fellow ruling families of Lunaris. This wasn’t just about welcoming me into the world. It was about power. Prestige. Making sure everyone knew exactly where we stood.

The Vale family arrived first, days ahead of the main event. Cedric Vale, their patriarch, brought his wife, Elara, and their daughters, Serina and Stephanie. Their son, Luke, was absent, probably off doing something important—though knowing Luke, that could’ve meant anything from a high-stakes mission to a mid-afternoon nap.

Now, here’s the thing—Mom was originally a Vale. Same bloodline. Same legacy. So our families weren’t just allies, we were bound by tradition, by history. 

Celestia and Stephanie had also been attached at the hip since childhood. Best friends. ****

The night before the big celebration, both families gathered for a private dinner—one last moment of calm before the storm of nobility, politics, and endless formalities. 

### **Ceremony**

The day of the grand celebration finally arrived, and with it came a flood of guests—each one a walking symbol of power and prestige. One by one, they arrived, their mere presence a reminder of just how far the Williams family’s influence reached.

Orion Everhart, head of the Everhart family, made his entrance with his two sons in tow, their every step oozing nobility**.** Representatives from the Norwood family, long-time allies of my father, arrived soon after. Then came the marquises Leonhart and Zesha. Many of the high-ranking nobles, and the distinguished families of Lunaris and many more.

But the one guest who stood out from the rest? **Zane.** Former Lord Commander of Avalon. A legend in his own right. And more importantly—one of my father’s most trusted friends. He hadn’t just come for the party. No, Dad had personally invited him for a private discussion once all the pleasantries were over.

The ceremony itself went off without a hitch. 

By the time the festivities wrapped up, the guests began their slow departure. One after another, they bid their farewells, their voices laced with congratulations and well wishes. The Vale family had to leave earlier than expected—urgent matters back home, something about “**Black veil**”. Their absence was noticeable, but no one questioned it. Politics worked in its own quiet, complicated ways.

Later that evening, after the castle had settled into a quieter hum, my family shared an intimate dinner, with Zane as our honored guest. The conversation stretched late into the night, lingering over fine meals and wine. There was laughter, yes, but also an underlying tension—the kind that hinted at words left unsaid. Zane, never one for patience, finally glanced over. **"***So, Lucian… what is it you wish to discuss with me?***"** Dad, his grin laced with mischief, leaned forward slightly. *"I want you to train my son in the coming years. I want you to be his mentor—his teacher."* Zane raised an eyebrow, clearly caught off guard. *"Me? Why? Don’t tell me you’re doubting your own ability. You’re more than capable of training him yourself, Lucian."*

*"Oh, I know I am. But you have an gift for bringing out the best in others.. I don’t want my son to settle for ‘good enough.’ I want him to learn from the very best. So, Zane, I’m asking you—take my child as your pupil."*

That's how it was decided—Zane would become my first combat teacher. From the day my training with him began, I had no idea just how lucky I truly was—until now.

Amidst all this, three years after my birth, Cel—who was ten at the time—left for the capital with Stephanie Vale to train under a Dual Manifestor— someone capable of wielding two Primordiums. It was meant to be a year-long training. But even now, she hasn’t come back. *Though… that’s a story for another time.*

### **13 Years Later**

**A few days ago,**

It was just another normal day—same as always. Dad wasn’t in Riverton; he had a meeting with Orion Everhart. You remember him, right? The guy who showed up at my naming ceremony with his two sons? Brian and Ryan—yeah, I know. Twin brothers, masters of Essence manipulation, five years older than me.

Dad was meeting with him to talk about developments on ***Case Black Veil*.**

That nightmare that’s been haunting Lunaris for the past fourteen years—since *my* birthday.

Yeah. I don’t know if I was born to bring some great contribution to the world, but one thing’s for sure—I definitely dragged an omen in with me.

The very first Black Veil incident happened on my first birthday. Remember the Vale family leaving early? That was why. It’s also one of the reasons I brought it up earlier.

So what exactly happened that day?

An entire village—*gone*. Not a single person left. The houses? Untouched. Their belongings? Still there. But the people? Vanished.

The first incident happened in the Vale domain. Then, it started happening in Riverton.  Then in Lucial. The disappearances weren’t as massive as the first one, but still—whoever was behind this wasn’t just strong. They were *smart*.

I wouldn’t even be surprised if they were a *Reality Influencer —one of the three type of primordium. The rarest one.*

Yeah, so like I said—it was just another normal day.

Me, Reus, and Chris were lounging on the castle walls, doing our usual evening strolls.

Who are Chris and Reus? Chris Valer—our maid’s son and Reus Saden—the heir to the Saden family, one of Riverton’s elite combat forces. The three of us couldn’t be more different. Total opposites. And yet, somehow… we just *clicked.* We’ve been inseparable since we were seven. These guys even train with me. 

We had planned to play in the garden that day—what felt like the best decision of my life… and also the worst. Who would've thought destiny had something like *that* in store for me? Anyway, we went to the garden to play volleyball.

As we were in the garden—the quieter, more secluded part of the castle grounds. The air was crisp, carrying the familiar scent of fresh grass and rose, Guards were in garden’s vicinity…..but something else too lingered. Something off.

Something was watching us.

I felt it. That eerie weight of unseen eyes pressing down. But then Chris was already pulling me into the game, so I brushed it off. Maybe I was imagining things.

We played. Chris, as hyper as ever, was practically bouncing off the walls, and even Reus—usually the serious one—was getting competative. And me? I was there. Forced into it. No escape. Just when I was about to convince myself to enjoy it, the ball bounced toward me—

And that’s when the chill hit me.

It shot down my spine, freezing me mid-movement. My instincts screamed at me to turn. So I did—just the slightest glance over my shoulder.

And for a split second, I *saw* it. A shadow. Lurking. Watching.

And then—gone.

Vanished, like it had never been there. My gut twisted. First that feeling of being watched, and now this? 

But who would be stupid enough to sneak into the Williams estate? No one with a functioning brain, that’s for sure. If they had a death wish, then… well, that was their problem.

So, I ignored it. Batted an eye again. And just when I as about to move on, the air shifted.

This time, it wasn’t a feeling.

It was real.

One of the guards—gone.

No sound. 

No struggle. 

Just… *gone*.

A sickening silence settled over the garden. The other two guards stiffened, their gazes sharp as they scanned the area, muscles tense, ready for a fight.

Reus and I noticed immediately.

A sinking weight formed in my stomach. The feeling from earlier? It hadn’t been my imagination. Something *was* here. And now, something *was* happening.

I met Reus’s eyes. We didn’t need words. Without hesitation, we split up, scanning different sections of the garden.

Looking back, maybe we should’ve just run.

Because the moment we started searching, we had already lost.

We combed through the area for nearly five minutes, the garden unnervingly silent. One of the guard approached Chris and motioned for him to head back into the castle with us. As he started walking toward me to signal my turn, it hit.

A presence.

*Dark*. *Overwhelming.*

It crashed into my mind like a tidal wave, sinking its claws deep into my consciousness.

I *froze*.

This was different. This wasn’t just a bad feeling. It was something far, *far* worse.

My body locked up. I couldn’t move.

And then—

I *saw* it.

A hand.

Pale. Grotesque. Emerging from the empty space right in front of me.

Just a hand.

And yet, the sheer *wrongness* of it sent terror surging through my entire being.

I tried to move. I *wanted* to move.

But before I could—

It *grabbed* my throat.

Cold. Like death itself.

I gasped, instinctively trying to coat my body in essence—*nothing*. My essence wouldn’t respond. My body refused to listen.

The grip tightened.

It was *pulling* me in.

Dragging me toward that warped space—toward the unknown.

Chris had reached me just in time to see it.

His mouth opened—he wanted to scream. He wanted to move.

But terror held him in place.

And just like that—

I was gone.

The only thing left in that garden was a single black rose, resting on the ground.

## **Whispering Cave**

The air was damp, thick with the scent of wet stone and decay. Water dripped from the jagged stalactites above, creating an eerie rhythm that echoed through the cavernous space. A Cave.

My consciousness stirred. My head throbbed, limbs feeling heavy. Slowly, my eyes fluttered open, and the blurred outlines of my surroundings sharpened into focus.

I wasn’t alone.

A man sat before me—broad-shouldered, well-built, dressed in simple yet refined attire. His presence exuded strength, but something about him felt... off. As my senses adjusted, I realized.

That scent.

A thick, unmistakable aura clung to the air, sending a primal chill down my spine. I lifted my gaze. Dark, amused eyes met mine. And then, that man smiled.

Sharp. Elongated.

Fangs.

A vampire.

My heartbeat pounded crazily, mind racing. Vampires were a rarity—ghosts in history, myths whispered among terrified villagers. Few ever saw one in their lifetime, and even fewer lived to speak of it. 

If a vampire was an Essence Manipulator, their energy levels dwarfed those of ordinary humans.

 If they were Manifestors, they became even deadlier.

And if they possessed Reality Influence...

There was no research. No records. No survivors.

Panic clawed at my throat, but before it could consume me, recognition struck me like a lightning bolt.

This wasn’t just any vampire.

This man...

"*You—*" My voice caught in my throat.

He smirked. “*Ah, so you do remember me……But before that, let me introduce to you myself. My Name is **Draven.*** ”

He was from Cedric Vale’s domain, a trusted knight within their ranks. I saw him many times when Cedric came to our domain. He was always with him and now that same guard now sat before me.

“*You... you were one of Cedric Vale’s men. A guard of Dunford.*”

Draven let out a chuckle, stretching lazily. *“I was many things.*” His eyes gleamed with amusement. “*Funny, isn’t it? All those years I spent within your walls, and no one ever suspected a thing. A fake history, a fabricated background... and suddenly, I was a knight.*” He leaned forward, grinning. “*Your father, Cedric, Orion all ran in circles for years, desperately searching for the culprit behind the disappearances. If only they had looked a little closer.*”

I was so confused. “*So it was you. You’re behind the Black Veil Incident.*”

Draven tilted his head. “*Black Veil...How dramatic.*” He met my glare and flashed another sharp-toothed grin. “*Yes, I was the one responsible. But let’s be honest... I was right under their noses, and they never even considered me.*” His expression darkened. “*Humans are such fools.*”

I was trapped. Alone. Facing something I had no chance of fighting. Only a handful of people in Lunaris could stand against such a monster, and obviously, I was not one of them. Not even close.

While I was thinking, something shifted.

A flash of movement.

An arc of energy sliced through the air.

Pain.

Agonizing, searing pain.

My mind barely registering what had happened, my vision blurred as my body convulsed.

Then—I saw it.

My arm.

Gone.

The next thing I saw was Draven holding my severed arm close to his mouth. His fangs gleamed in the dim light as he sank them into the flesh.

The sickening sound of tearing. The sensation of bones cracking. Draven sighed in pleasure, licking the blood from his lips.

“*You taste even better than I expected,*” he murmured, his voice dripping with satisfaction.

My screams were raw, filled with agony. My body trembled uncontrollably, my mind barely able to grasp the sheer horror unfolding.

Draven chuckled. “*Oh, don’t pass out on me now.*” His grin widened, his crimson eyes glowing with excitement.

“*I’m going to enjoy eating you.*” Saying that, Draven left the cave, leaving me in that pitiful state.

The pain was so overwhelming that I couldn't even process the horrifying reality—my arm was completely torn off. Blood gushed from the wound, pooling beneath me in a sickening crimson flood. It was a torrent I couldn’t escape, soaking into the cold, unforgiving stone beneath me. I couldn't feel anything but the searing agony, every nerve in my body screaming in protest, and yet there was nothing I could do but lie there, suffering. I was helpless. Completely. Utterly helpless.

Minutes passed. Maybe hours. Time felt irrelevant, like it had warped into some strange, unrecognizable thing. I couldn’t tell how long I’d been here, how long I’d been drifting in and out of consciousness, caught in the agony of it all.

Summoning what little strength I had left, I gathered every ounce of willpower and forced my essence into the gaping wound. The sensation was almost worse than the pain itself—my essence coursing through me, crawling into the torn flesh, desperately trying to seal the veins, trying to stop the bleeding. The pain was unbearable, a constant, unrelenting ache that threatened to swallow me whole, but I had no choice. I knew I couldn’t just let it take me. I clenched my teeth so hard I thought they might crack, my muscles trembling with the effort, refusing to let my consciousness slip away. My vision swam, the edges of everything going blurry and distorted, but I fought it. Slowly, ever so slowly, my breathing steadied, each breath feeling like a battle in itself.

After what felt like an eternity, I regained a sliver of composure—just enough to push through the next hurdle. My body screamed in protest, each movement a fresh wave of torment. But I couldn’t stop. I had to move. Had to do something—anything to get out of this hell.

My eyes darted around the cave, desperate for some kind of answer, some way out. I couldn’t afford to stay here. I had to find something, some way to keep going. And then, in the distance, I spotted it—a narrow path winding deeper into the darkness, the same route Draven had taken when he left. My heart pounded in my chest. It was a lifeline, or at least it could be.

He was a vampire—one with Reality Influence Primordium. He literally tore open a warp from nowhere and dragged me through it. And then, he used some kind of strange attack to slice my hand… I still don’t even know what he did.

The first vampire I ever laid eyes on… and he might be an dual Primordium wielder.

What kind of cursed luck was I born with?

 But then, a new thought struck me, sharp and cold.

Why had he left me here?

If Draven had wanted me dead, there was no reason for him to leave me alive. No reason at all. And yet, here I was—bleeding out, broken, but alive. This wasn’t a mercy. This wasn’t a mistake. It was a game. He was playing with me. I was nothing more than a pawn to him, a tool in whatever twisted game he had going on in that mind of his. The realization hit me like a stone to the chest, heavy and suffocating. Draven had no reason to keep me alive.

But I didn’t have the luxury of thinking about it for too long. I had no choice. There was only one thing I could do now. I had to move forward. There was no other option.

So, despite the pain, despite the exhaustion threatening to pull me under, I forced my body to take the first step. My legs trembled beneath me, my movements shaky and uneven. But I kept going. One step, then another, each footfall sending a jolt of pain up my spine. I didn’t stop. I couldn’t.

For half an hour, I walked. The silence of the cave pressed in on me, suffocating. Every breath I took felt like it might be my last, my chest tightening with every inhale. The only sound that broke the silence was the rasp of my breathing, the quiet echo of my labored steps. And yet, despite the agony that coursed through me, I couldn’t stop. Not yet. Then suddenly,

Laughter.

A cruel, mocking laugh.

Draven stood ahead, leaning casually against the cave wall, his crimson eyes gleaming with amusement.

*“Hahaha! I knew you’d come,”* he sneered. *“I was waiting for you.”* He licked his lips, his fangs glinting in the dim light. *“I got hungry again… maybe this time, I’ll take one of the legs.”*

Hearing that surged panic within me, and I instantly started acting. I was about to move away from him while rambling random things. *“N-no… please, not again,”* I stammered, my voice trembling. *“Why don’t you just kill me? That—”*

Before I could even finish, a streak of energy sliced through the air.

This time, I saw it clearly—he conjured a blade of wind straight from his palm.

He was definitely a dual Primordium user—and a Manifestor, no doubt about it.

I barely registered the pain, but before I knew it, my left leg was severed from my body.

The world tilted. My vision blurred. The shock was instant, but the pain—the pain—was beyond anything I had ever experienced.

A guttural scream tore from my throat, raw and agonizing. My body convulsed, my hands clawing at the ground, desperate for something—anything—to hold on to.

Draven caught the severed limb through a void portal, bringing it close. He inspected it for a moment before taking a bite.

Then, with a look of disgust, he spat it out and tossed the leg back onto me.

*“Ugh. This is shit.”* He clicked his tongue, his expression filled with disdain. *“Maybe I should’ve taken the other arm instead.”*

I thrashed on the ground, my cries of agony filling the cavern. My body trembled violently, my mind on the verge of collapse. My breathing came in short, ragged gasps, my senses drowning in unbearable torment.

I couldn’t take it.

My vision darkened.

And then—

Everything faded to black.

Draven let out an annoyed sigh, clicking his tongue. *“Tch. Passed out already?”* He shook his head, turning away. *“Boring.”*

With that, he disappeared into the shadows, leaving me lying there—unconscious, broken, and bleeding out onto the cold, unforgiving stone.

### **Spatial Realm**

My eyes fluttered open, a blur of confusion clouding my vision. Tears welled up. The pain had dulled into a numb, hollow sensation. My body felt like it was made of shattered glass, every movement sending waves of agony through me, but there was nothing left to break. My face was flushed, streaked with tears that fell without me even realizing it. Why was I crying? Was it the pain? Or was it something worse—the cruel reminder of everything I’d lost?

I swallowed hard, the lump in my throat burning like acid. My body was hanging on by a thread, but I pushed what was left of my aura through the wreckage of my limbs, desperate to summon even the smallest bit of strength. It felt like dragging myself through quicksand, but I didn’t have a choice. I couldn’t stop now. I wouldn’t.

So I walked.

I knew what was ahead. I knew it was just him—Draven. That monster, that twisted, sadistic creature who had taken everything from me. I knew there was no escape. No sudden miracle. No happy ending waiting to pull me from this hell.

But I kept moving.

Not because I hoped to find salvation. Not because I was defying fate.

But because in the depths of my broken mind, there was only one thought that refused to leave me: *I wish I could have one more dinner with my family.*

It was a stupid thought, I knew that. A useless, empty wish. But it was the only thing that kept me going, the only thing that anchored me to reality. The thought of seeing them all one more time—sitting at the table, laughing, eating… I clung to that like it was my lifeline.

So I walked.

Minutes turned into hours. Hours stretched into an eternity. Time was meaningless here. The cave was endless—just an unforgiving path of jagged rock and suffocating silence. My body screamed for rest, my throat was dry and raw from thirst, and every muscle felt like it was about to snap. But I couldn’t stop. I wouldn’t.

I had nothing left.

The world spun around me, everything blurring, my legs barely holding me up. My vision swam like a distorted painting, my aura—my very life—was hanging by a thread. I was on the edge, my body trembling, my breath shallow. If I collapsed now, it was over.

And just then, he stepped into a different part of the cave. It wasn’t just another tunnel. It felt… deliberate. Like a room carved from the mountain itself. Ancient. Ritualistic.

Water was dripping here and there, torches burned along the jagged walls, their flames dancing wildly, casting flickering shadows that made the stone seem alive. The air was thick with the scent of smoke and damp earth, and somewhere beneath it all… blood.

And there he was—.

Draven.

Standing there.

I was too exhausted to react. My body refused to move, as if it had forgotten how to obey. Every inch of me was screaming for rest, but there was no comfort here. I wasn’t even shocked anymore—just… resigned. Resigned to this twisted game Draven played, to the inevitable end that loomed over me.

The silence pressed in, thick and suffocating, until Draven’s voice sliced through it—sharp, cruel, and dripping with amusement.

*“So… should I take your right arm this time? Or maybe your head? I wonder how pathetic you’d look then without any arms and legs”*

His words were poison, meant to twist the knife deeper. I could feel his gaze burning into me, savoring every ounce of fear he’d already wrung out of me.

I should’ve been afraid. I should’ve been terrified, struggling, fighting, anything—but I was beyond that. His words didn’t even have the power to shock me anymore. They were just another cruel reminder of my helplessness, of how completely I had been broken.

Then I saw it—the way he raised his hand. Slow. Calculated. The flick of his wrist as he made a mocking, slow slashing motion through the air. The motion wasn’t just a threat—it was a taunt. A reminder of how little I mattered to him. How much he reveled in this. The way he toyed with me like I was nothing more than a plaything.

As Draven closed in, I did the only thing I could—I poured what little essence I had left across my entire body, trying to harden it like armor. My instincts screamed at me to survive, to *do something*.

But then—*everything stopped.*

My vision went dark. No—not dark. It was *emptiness*. A pitch-black void, like the world itself had vanished.

And in the middle of that nothingness… a light.

A glowing, golden sphere. Small. Pulsing. Floating.

It radiated with essence so pure, so immense, it made the air around it *hum*. I couldn’t move. Couldn’t breathe. Could only *watch*. And somehow, I *knew*—it wasn’t just essence. It was something older. Something deeper. *Something alive.*

Before I could reach for it—before I could even *think*—the vision vanished.

Suddenly I was back, breath catching in my throat, every nerve in my body alive. Something had shifted inside me. I didn’t understand it, couldn’t name it… but I could *feel* it.

Something had awakened.

And I had no idea what that meant—but was something that was going to save my life.

And just as Draven faked his strike—too slow, too confident, too sure of his victory, a desperate instinct clawing at the edges of my consciousness, urging me to move.

**BOOM.**

Everything stopped.

I mean, *everything*.

For a second, it felt like the entire world held its breath. The air felt heavy—thick. Draven? Mid-swing, arm stretched out like he was about to deliver that final, mocking blow. His eyes still gleamed with that smug satisfaction.

Water? Droplets just hanging there, suspended in midair. Like the world forgot how to fall.

The flames of the torches? Frozen, too. They didn’t flicker. Didn’t dance. The whole cave went still, silent.

And then, the strangest part? Even Draven’s heartbeat—gone. Nothing.

It was like everything took a pause. Like the universe hit *stop* and left me behind, still breathing, still thinking, and still *freaking out* inside my head.

And then— **BOOM.**

Time snapped back. The air rushed back into my lungs, and the world came alive again. Water splattered to the ground. The torches flickered. Draven’s arm jerked forward, his cocky expression still in place like he hadn’t just been frozen in time.

But me? I was standing there one my single leg, completely dazed, my heart racing, trying to make sense of what the hell just happened. Did—did I just freeze time? Is that even possible?

I felt it. I *knew* something had changed. But I couldn’t put it into words. It was like my body had done something it shouldn’t be able to do. Something no one should be able to do. *But I had.*

I didn’t know why or how. But it happened.

And whatever it was? It felt *big*. Too big for me to ignore. I had no clue what it meant, but I knew, in the back of my mind, it was gonna change everything. Change me.

I shook myself out of it. Had to. No time to think. Because Draven, clueless as ever, didn’t even realize what just happened. He was still in full mock mode, trying to push my buttons like it was another damn game.

But then—he felt it. Just a tiny, imperceptible shift in his demeanor. He felt *something*. His confidence was a little shaken, just for a second. His eyes narrowed.

Then, without warning, he went all in. No more playtime. No more fakes. His aura flared up in his arm—this time, the strike was real. No games.

“*Well, I’m done with you now,*” Draven sneered, his voice dripping with malice. He raised his hand, fingers curling like claws, the air around him crackling with lethal intent.

I wasn’t ready. I wasn’t thinking.

My brain was still whirling with what had just happened. But then, instinct kicked in. Pure, raw survival.

I had no time. I didn’t even stop to think.

**SNAP.**

**BOOM.**

Time froze again.

Draven’s attack froze midair—an Essence slash, sharp and glowing, suspended just inches from my face. It hung there, unnaturally still, like the world had skipped a beat. His grin hadn’t faded, lips curled in that same smug confidence. His eyes were wide, full of pride—

*This is my chance.*

I didn’t waste a second. My body moved before my brain could catch up. I dove to the side, barely missing the slash by inches. Time snapped back into place. 

**BOOM**

 …..and the world resumed like nothing happened. But Draven? He stepped forward like he’d won, sure that I was just another casualty, another easy kill.

But I wasn’t where he thought I’d be.

***Impossible**.*

Eyes narrowing, confused. He took a step back, his brow furrowing in disbelief. His eyes flicked to the space where I *should* have been, and for the first time, I saw something on his face—*doubt*.

He couldn’t wrap his head around it. No way in hell could someone like me have dodged that attack. There was no way I was fast enough, not with the difference between his speed and mine. But here I was. Alive. Standing.

And Draven? He couldn’t figure it out. His confidence was cracked, and for a brief moment, he was left with nothing but questions.

And I—*I*—wasn’t done yet.

Annoyance flashed across Draven’s face, his lips curling into a sneer. It shifted into frustration, his sharp eyes narrowing. The confusion only deepened. He couldn’t make sense of what had just happened.

I, on the other hand, was completely lost. My mind was a storm of chaos, a whirlwind of panic, confusion, and adrenaline. What the hell did I just do? I didn’t have the time—or clarity—to make sense of it, but one thing was painfully clear: this was something big. Something far beyond anything I’d ever trained for.

*Most likely… a second Primordium.* And not just any kind—*Reality Influence.* But if that’s true… then what the hell was that golden light I saw just before it all happened? That flash—*that* moment—wasn’t just some random thought. It felt like something deep inside me had cracked open. Like this power didn’t come from me, but *through* me.

The thought alone made my skin crawl. I couldn’t even process it. My thoughts were flashing like broken lightning, scattered and frantic, each one louder than the last. Nothing made sense. And yet… somehow, deep down, I knew everything had just changed.

Now came the real problem—*what the hell was I supposed to do with this power?* And how was I going to scale the mountain that stood ahead of me? Because if I couldn’t figure out how to kill—or at the very least, incapacitate—Draven **right now**, then none of this would matter.

I’d be dead.

I wasn’t fooling myself. I couldn’t keep dodging his attacks forever. Wounding him wasn’t going to cut it. Not with someone like Draven. He’d figure it out, adapt, and come back stronger. If I didn’t end this now, I wouldn’t get another chance.

I swallowed hard. My whole body screamed for rest, but the fight was still on. My only option? To finish it. *Now.*

The silence between us was suffocating, thick with tension. Time seemed to stretch out like a rubber band pulled too far, waiting to snap.

Finally, Draven spoke. His voice was cold, venom lacing each word.

“Brat, what the hell did you just do? And how?”

I didn’t flinch, didn’t even blink. My expression was flat, blank. As if this was just another bad day. “What are you talking about?”

His eyes darkened, narrowing with that deadly focus. “Don’t play dumb. You *dodged* my attack. If you had this ability, why didn’t you avoid my last two hits? Tell me the truth, or I’ll make sure your death is the most agonizing thing you could ever imagine.”

I knew Draven. He didn’t want answers. He wanted to *break me*. But I couldn’t afford to mess this up. A reckless answer would only make him angry—*angrier*. The last thing I needed was to set him off more.

I paused. Gritting my teeth, I gave him just enough to keep him from going ballistic. “I saw it coming.”

It wasn’t a lie. I *had* seen it coming. Just not in the way Draven would ever understand.

Draven clicked his tongue in frustration, the sound echoing through the cave. Without another word, he began to walk toward me, his steps heavy, deliberate. Each one felt like a hammer against my chest.

I had **seconds** to think. As Draven closed the distance between us, my mind raced—*spinning, scrambling*. I couldn’t just stall him. Couldn’t just land a hit. He had to be ended. For good.

And the worst part? I hadn’t even figured out how to use this new phenomenon to my advantage.

A simple punch wouldn’t cut it. Hell, even driving a blade through his heart wouldn’t be enough—*vampires aren’t human.* They don’t just keel over from a fatal wound. I knew he wouldn’t die that easily.

I remembered hearing stories about vampires and how sunlight was their true weakness, but in this cave, surrounded by pitch-black darkness? Sunlight wasn’t going to help me here.

A wooden stake through the heart could paralyze him—maybe even kill him, if I got lucky. Wounds from wood were dangerous for vampires, sometimes even fatal. But I sure as hell wasn’t pulling one out of thin air.

*If only I were a Manifestation user…* 

The only shot I had was to immobilize him—or hit him hard enough to shatter his focus, to drive him so far into chaos he couldn’t stay sane long enough to stop me from escaping this cave.

Then, it hit me.

*Decapitation.*

It wouldn’t kill Draven outright, but without his head? His body would stop functioning. He’d be useless. At least for a while. And that would give me enough time to figure out my next move.

Could I pull it off, though?

I had no sword. No weapons. My aura was nearly depleted. Draven’s skin? Tougher than steel. A clean cut through his neck? *Impossible*.

Then, a flash of memory hit me.

Zane’s face appeared in my mind, clear as day.

**A lesson with Zane, A distant Memory.**

---

“You think this half-hearted effort will take you anywhere?” Zane’s voice cut through my thoughts like a knife.
A much younger me sat there on the training grounds, drenched in sweat, exhausted. I was struggling—so hard—trying and failing to pull my aura into my arms. Something so basic for an Essence Manipulator. It was supposed to be simple, but in that moment? It felt impossible.
"I know you’re struggling," Zane’s voice softened for a moment, almost like he was trying to calm me down. "You’re overthinking it. *You’re trying to force something that won’t come naturally.*"
His words hit me like a hammer. He was right. I was overthinking it. My mind raced a thousand miles per minute, trying to figure out the “right” way to make it happen, trying to live up to something I couldn’t even grasp yet.
"*You’re constantly being compared to your sister. You feel like you have to meet everyone’s expectations. But that pressure? That doubt? It’s all meaningless—until you’re in a position where you truly need to make it happen.*"
"*The moment you reach that breaking point, it will either consume you... or you’ll break past your limits.*"

---

Draven was nearly on me. The ground shook with his heavy steps. I could feel the heat of his aura—his presence pressing down on me like an iron weight.

*I clenched my fists. This was it**.** My breaking point. My last shot.*

My aura felt like a flicker of a flame in my chest, too weak to do anything. Could I gather it in time? **Impossible.**

*But I had to.* I didn’t have a choice.

“D-Don’t come any closer! Stay away!” I stammered, forcing the words out through gritted teeth. I had to pretend, to feign fear—make Draven think he had the upper hand.

I could feel the sneer in his gaze. The arrogance. He wasn’t fooled. He saw right through it, taking my words lightly as he moved closer, his guard half-lowered, convinced of his superiority.

*Pathetic.*

His confidence bled through the air. He thought I was nothing. And that’s what would kill him.

Chuckling, Draven gathered his own aura, the energy humming with dangerous intensity. He was a second away from decapitating me. I could feel it, the weight of the blade in his hand, ready to bring it down on my neck.

And then—just as Draven’s attack was within inches of me—

**SNAP.**

**BOOM.**

The world twisted. The last thing Draven saw was the snap of my fingers, and in that single instant, his entire world flipped upside down.

Confusion tore through him. For a split second, he was completely disoriented—lost in the chaos. One moment he was lunging forward, the next, he was suspended midair… staring at the cave ceiling upside down.

He felt… *distant*. Like his body wasn’t even his own.

Then he felt it—a sudden tug, a tightness around his hair.

His gaze darted up, and when his eyes met mine, his mouth opened, but no sound came out. The world slowed. Time seemed to stretch.

**I was holding his head by the hair.**

I wasn’t sure if it was blood, sweat, or both dripping down my face, but I didn’t care. All I could focus on was his lifeless eyes staring back at me. I grinned, slow and cold. The blood on my lips didn’t seem so terrible now.

*"It wasn’t very wise of you to underestimate this ‘brat,’ was it?*" I whispered, my voice a chill that cut through the dark cave.

“*You were going to feast on me, right?*” I tilted his head, letting my words hang between us like the calm before a storm. "*Well, let's see how you do that now."*

Without hesitation, I drove my fingers **straight into his eyes**, feeling the soft, sickening pop as his vision was torn away from him.

Draven screamed—his voice warping with an inhuman pitch that rattled my bones.

Next, I tore off his ears—shredding his ability to hear anything, turning his desperate cries into meaningless wails.

Draven wailed in a panic, helpless.

With a sick, twisted smirk, I reached for his nose—ripped it off, leaving him without any sense of smell.

The once-mighty vampire was now reduced to **nothing but a blind, deaf, disfigured head.**

### **The Exit**

Now that Draven was decapitated—severed from his senses, blind and deaf—I knew I had only a *small* window to act.

I had two choices.

One: destroy his entire body. Head and all. But that carried too much risk. His main body was still moving, twitching violently, and I didn’t have the strength to face it head-on again. If I failed, if I even *hesitated*, it could’ve cost me my life.

So I chose the second option.

I’d find the exit. I’d carry his cursed head out of this forsaken place and expose it to the one thing that could kill him for good—sunlight**.**

I kept walking, dragging my battered leg down the same path I had been on since the start. My vision blurred. My lungs burned. But I didn’t stop.

Behind me, Draven was screaming. Rambling in agony.

*“Brat! What have you done to me?!”*

*“RETURN ME TO MY BODY, YOU WORTHLESS TRASH! DO YOU THINK YOU’VE WON?!”*

I ignored every word. Let him scream. Let him *feel* powerless.

Still, one thought clawed at my mind—one that terrified me to my core.

*What if he used a portal to summon his head back to his body?*

*What if he pulled me along with it?*

But I didn’t have time to weigh the odds. It was a gamble—but one I had to take. It was still safer than confronting his body in its berserk state.

So I ran. Limped. Stumbled. Anything to keep moving forward.

And then—I saw it.

A distant glow. Faint at first, like a star on the horizon. But it grew brighter with every agonizing step.

*The exit.*

For a heartbeat, I froze.

A surge of emotion rose in my chest—relief, disbelief, hope. I had *truly* thought I was going to die down here. That this cave would be my grave. But here I was. Bruised, bleeding, broken—yet alive. Holding the decapitated head of a monster who had nearly ended me.

I forced my legs to move faster. My heart pounded. My hands trembled as I clutched Draven’s skull. I could almost taste the air outside, feel the sun’s warmth reach for me.

And then—

I stepped out.

Light washed over me like a tidal wave—bright, golden, *alive.*

Draven's head began to scream.

A shriek tore from his mouth, high-pitched and feral, as smoke started to curl from his flesh.

His skin bubbled. Cracked. Flaked.

“NO—NOOOO! WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!”

The sun scorched him like fire from the heavens. His cries became incoherent, nothing more than gurgled wails of pain. Then—

Ash.

His flesh disintegrated. His bones blackened. And all that remained was a brittle, lifeless skull, crumbling in my grip.

I stared at it.

A wave of exhaustion hit me like a tidal wave.

My knees buckled. My vision dimmed. The last thing I felt was the warm sun on my face—before the world turned black.

**I passed out.**

**Still holding Draven’s skull in my hand.**
