Chapter 1: Summer’s POV**

***Summer, lying on the bed—missing an arm and a leg, silent and still.***

*I am Summer Williams, son of Lucian Williams and Lillian Williams. And, of course, the younger brother of the Reaper Fang. At just fourteen years old, I am as unremarkable as one could be—or at least, that’s what I believed. That’s what everyone believed.*

*My Essence Manipulation? Painfully average. No special traits. No prodigious talent. Just me, stuck in the endless grind. Drills at dawn, lectures that felt like they lasted centuries, sparring sessions that left my arms shaking. And still, nothing extraordinary. My essence control was textbook. My combat instincts? Decent, but nothing that would make anyone turn their head. No elemental affinity, no flashy abilities. In a world where monsters in human form rewrite history, I was just another kid swinging a sword, hoping to matter.*

*But the thing about fate? It doesn’t ask for permission.* 

## Nation Of Peace: Lunaris

One of the Five Continents, Avalon—a land of mountains, rivers, and untamed seas. A place where history breathes through the soil, and power isn’t just held, but wielded. Of the eleven known sentient species, Humans and Elves stand as the dominant forces within its cities and courts. Beastfolk and Werewolves dwell here too, though their presence is sparse, scattered across wilder regions. 

Seventeen nations rise and endure within Avalon, each with its own secrets, rulers, and legacies. Among them, one stands apart—Lunaris. A purely human nation, often called the Nation of Peace, known for its diplomacy, healing arts, and unwavering neutrality in intercontinental conflicts. It is divided into three domains—Dunford, Lucial and Riverton, each ruled by one of the Three Great Noble Families: Everhart, Vale, and Williams.

The Vales were renowned for their combat prowess and mastery of Manifestation, while the Everharts earned their name through unmatched research in medicine, potions, and cures—holding firm influence in both warfare and healing.

And then there’s us. The Williams family, lords of Riverton, the beating economic heart of Lunaris. We deal in power—both the kind that fuels the body and the kind that fuels nations.

### ***Primordium.***

*Primordium—the force that shapes our world. The energy that turns ordinary men into legends. But not everyone is blessed with it. In truth, only one in hundred people ever awaken an affinity for Primordium at all.*
Among those who awaken it, most fall into one of two paths. The **Manifestors**, who unleash raw energy and shape it however they desire—and the **Manipulators**, who channel their power inward, enhancing their bodies, senses, or even nature itself. Both paths are fundamentally rooted in one's own Essence.

Then there's the third kind—the rarest of them all. **Reality Influencers**. One in a thousand among Primordium users, so scarce they're more legend than reality, even among the gifted. They don’t just use power—they bend the rules of existence, rewriting what is and isn’t possible. Their abilities are still tied to Essence in some form, though the connection is elusive and hard to define.

**Williams Family**

At the head of it all? My father, Lucian Williams. A man whose name carries weight across Avalon. A tactician, a warrior, a master Manipulator. His victories in the Wars across nations didn’t just earn him a title—they carved our name into history. From Counts to Marquesses, our rise was his doing.

And my mother? Lillian Williams, born of the Vale bloodline. A Manifestor—rare beyond words. A woman whose abilities defied every expectation placed upon her.

Together, they built something unshakable.

And then there’s my sister, Cel….Celestia Williams.

At just the age of seven, she managed to manipulate Essence voluntarily walking on her way to become an exceptional Manipulator She wasn’t just talented—she was terrifying. A prodigy whose potential could shatter expectations, who could stand above warriors twice, even three times her age. She was the kind of child that history remembers.

And me?

I was… nothing. I WAS….

*Before I tell you how I ended up like this—crippled, with one leg and one arm gone—I need to give you some context. To understand any of it, we have to go back to when it all truly began… when I was born. Thirteen… no, fourteen years ago.*

## **Origin**

You know how summer feels, right? Warm. Wild. Full of life. My parents must’ve thought the same thing when they named me. Maybe they believed I’d bring the same kind of energy into their lives. Or maybe they just liked the way it sounded. Either way, Baby Summer had arrived.

April 1st—the day the news spread like wildfire. Not just in our household, but all across Lunaris. My dad, Lucian Williams, the kind of man who doesn’t do things halfway**,** personally picked my name. **Summer.** According to him “*A name meant to stand for strength, warmth, and a future so bright it could outshine the sun.*”

And, of course, with a name like that, my arrival couldn’t be some quiet little affair. No. It had to be legendary.

A grand naming ceremony was planned, the kind that made a statement. Not just a party, but a declaration—**"**Here he is. The next heir of the Williams family. Remember the name.**"** Invitations were sent out to marquises, counts from neighboring nations, Dad’s war comrades, Mom’s closest friends, and, naturally, the Vales and Everharts—our fellow ruling families of Lunaris. This wasn’t just about welcoming me into the world. It was about power. Prestige. Making sure everyone knew exactly where we stood.

The Vale family arrived first, days ahead of the main event. Cedric Vale, their patriarch, brought his wife, Elara, and their daughters, Serina and Stephanie. Their son, Luke, was absent, probably off doing something important—though knowing Luke, that could’ve meant anything from a high-stakes mission to a mid-afternoon nap.

Now, here’s the thing—Mom was originally a Vale. Same bloodline. Same legacy. So our families weren’t just allies, we were bound by tradition, by history. 

Celestia and Stephanie had also been attached at the hip since childhood. Best friends. ****

The night before the big celebration, both families gathered for a private dinner—one last moment of calm before the storm of nobility, politics, and endless formalities. 

### **Ceremony**

The day of the grand celebration finally arrived—and with it, a tide of guests, each a living emblem of power and prestige. They entered one after another, their presence alone a reminder of how far the Williams family’s influence had reached.

The reception was held in the Grand Hall of Riverton Castle. It was wide and tall, with smooth stone walls and a ceiling so high it felt like it touched the sky. Tall pillars lined both sides, each carved with symbols from ancient times. Soft golden lights from crystal chandeliers filled the hall, making everything feel warm and grand. Banners of the three noble families—Everhart, Vale, and Williams—hung proudly along the walls. At the center was a raised platform where the ceremony would take place, surrounded by chairs and tables set for the many noble guests. The whole place had this quiet, powerful feel—like every stone had seen centuries of history.

Orion Everhart, head of the Everhart family, strode in with his twin sons flanking him—each step measured, noble. The Norwoods, long-time allies of my father, followed not long after. Then came the marquises Leonhart and Zesha.

The halls soon swelled with high-ranking nobles and distinguished families from across Lunaris and beyond. Blackthorn, Crestborne, Frostly, Silvaran, Brightwal, Thornveil and many more share audience.

But one guest stood apart from them all.

**Zane.** Former Lord Commander of Avalon. A legend among warriors. More importantly—my father’s closest friend.

> (*Lord Commander—the one who leads a major military force or order across the continent.*)
> 

He didn’t come for the wine or music. His arrival was quiet, deliberate. Dad had invited him for something far more important than celebration.

The ceremony went smoothly. Speeches were made. Toasts were raised. Eventually, the guests began to drift away, their parting words filled with warmth and formality.

That night, as the castle settled into a calm stillness, my family gathered for a private dinner. Zane dined with us, along with members of the Vale family. There was wine, good food, laughter—but beneath it all lingered something heavier. A quiet tension. A conversation waiting for the right moment.

Eventually, Zane leaned back in his chair and gave my father a pointed look.

*"Lucian... what is it you’ve really called me here for?"*

Dad’s smile widened, touched with familiarity and something more serious. He leaned in just slightly.

*"I want you to train my son."*

Zane blinked. Not in disbelief—but in surprise. *"You? Asking me that? Come on, Lucian. You’ve trained warriors that’ve made history. You’re more than qualified to train your own child."*

*"Qualified? Sure. But I know my limits—and I know yours."* Dad’s tone shifted, something firmer beneath the words. *"You’ve always had a way of pulling greatness out of people. I don’t want my son to be just another swordsman. I want him to rise above that. To see the world like you do, to fight like you do. No shortcuts. No comfort zones."*

He looked Zane in the eye.

*"So I’m asking, as a friend—take him under your wing."*

For a moment, Zane said nothing. Then came the faintest smirk. A nod. No grand speech. Just quiet agreement.

And just like that, it was decided—Zane would become my first combat teacher.

Back then, I had no idea just how lucky I was.

Not until much, much later.

***This is where it started. The beginning of everything.***

Dinner with the family had just wrapped up, and everyone was preparing to call it a night when suddenly—a Dunford guard arrived at Williams Castle. His face was pale, uniform soaked in sweat and urgency. He requested a private audience with Cedric Vale.

At first, it seemed like a personal matter—something internal to the Vale family. But not long after, Cedric called for my father, Lucian, and Zane.

That’s when I first heard the name that would come to define the darkest days of my life.

*Case Black Veil.*

And it all started on my birthday. Yeah, lucky me. I don’t know if I was born to change the world or break it, but I sure as hell dragged an omen in with me.

So what exactly was Black Veil?

Cedric told as It began small—quiet. Four people vanished in broad daylight from a tavern in Dunford. Seemed like a typical missing persons case… until a witness stepped forward. He claimed he saw them being pulled into some kind of rift—a shimmering portal that blinked out of existence the moment they were taken.

That was strange. Unbelievable, even. But still, something you might chalk up to delusion or drunken rambling.

Until the guard who was present in shared the real news—the reason his hands wouldn’t stop shaking.

An entire village was gone.

*Not burned. Not attacked. Just…gone.*

*Every home stood untouched—doors ajar, candles still flickering, meals half-eaten on wooden tables. Clothes laid out for the next day, tools frozen mid-use, chairs toppled as if their owners had vanished mid-conversation. It was as if the entire village had been plucked out of existence in the blink of an eye.*

That’s when everyone in the room fell silent. No more doubts. No more second-guessing.

The Vale family mobilized immediately. My father joined them. And just like that, the Black Veil investigation had begun.

The nightmare had arrived—and none of us knew just how deep it would go.

---

Amidst all this, after three years, Cel—who was ten at the time—left for the capital with Stephanie Vale to train under someone capable of wielding two Primordiums. It was meant to be a year-long training. But even now, she hasn’t come back. *Though… that’s a story for another time.*
