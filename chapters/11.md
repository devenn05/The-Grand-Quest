“Let me bring my sword and a spare one I have in my bag.“

“Just how big is your bag, man? I mutter, watching him dig through it again. I'm starting to think it's like a portal is opening inside and things just keep spawning.“

Ronan laughs under his breath. "Haha... well, I do carry my stuff around carefully. Never know when I'd need it. Danger could come from anywhere. Like now.”

“Some rat’s been watching us all day, but I can’t pinpoint them."

It took me a second to even comprehend what he just said. Wait. What? So I wasn’t being paranoid after all. Someone really is watching us.

I shoot back immediately, "I’ve been feeling it too, since noon. So... what do we do?"

"Nothing."

"Nothing?" I stare at him like he’s lost his mind.

"Yeah. Nothing," he says again, calm like he's talking about the weather.

"Isn’t that a bit risky? They could ambush us when we sleep."

"Summer, my friend," Ronan says with a half-smile, "whoever this is can hide their presence completely. The only reason we’re sensing anything is through sheer instinct. That alone tells me they’re strong. Stronger than you. Stronger than me. If they wanted to ambush us, they already would’ve."

He shifts slightly, glancing back toward the woods. "Still... I’ll stay up tonight. Don’t want anyone touching Aurora."

"Stronger than you?" I repeat, stunned.

"Yeah. Probably."

Someone stronger than this giant of a man is stalking us, and I’m supposed to sleep tonight?

No way in hell.

Should I try finding them?

Then again... provoking something stronger than Ronan sounded like the dumbest idea I could ever cook up.

While my mind spins with a hundred bad ideas, Ronan casually returns, carrying two swords.

"How can you be so carefree, Ronan? Aren’t you feeling anxious?"

"I am," he admits, tossing one sword from hand to hand like it’s a toy. "But the one thing I’m sure of? Whoever’s out there... they’re not hostile. If they were, we’d feel their killing intent."

"Still, I could—"

"Enough talking," he cuts in with a grin. "I want to see how Zane’s pupil handles a blade."

Before I can say anything, he tosses a sword my way. I catch it reflexively, the familiar weight settling into my hand.

Ahh... I missed this. A real sword, not some stupid branch pretending to be one.

The blade hums faintly against my palm as I give it a small swing, feeling the old rhythm come back.

"Let’s begin," Ronan says, planting his feet with a grin that promises pain.

Without any warning, the words barely leaving his mouth, Ronan thunders toward me — a straight slash coming with a real killing intent.

My instincts fire off before my brain can even catch up. I anticipate the attack and hurl myself sideways, barely dodging the first blow. The force of his swing cuts the air itself. I stagger a few steps back, trying to put distance between us, trying to hold my ground.

But he doesn't give me even a breath. Ronan lunges forward again, a brutal slash slicing toward my side.

No time to dodge. I raise my sword and meet it head-on.

The impact rattles my arms to the bones.

It’s heavy.

Heavy enough that if I didn’t brace properly, he could have just crushed me in one stroke.

Move, Summer!

Pushing the numbness from my arms, I make the first aggressive move — throwing a sharp kick toward his legs, aiming to knock him off balance.

It’s like kicking a stone wall.

Ronan doesn’t even budge.

Cursing under my breath, I swing my blade in a tight arc, aiming for his neck — faster, sharper this time.

But just as my sword is about to reach him, he shifts his weight and drives a kick straight into my stomach.

Pain explodes through my ribs.

The next thing I know, I’m flying backward, landing hard a meter away, skidding in the dirt.

Damn, that packed enough power to send me halfway across the camp.

I grit my teeth and try to scramble up — but before I can even get onto one knee, I feel the cold kiss of steel against my neck.

Ronan’s sword is already there, angled just enough to say, You lost.

"Not bad for a fourteen-year-old boy," he says, amused.

"Yeah, a clean defeat. Real impressive," I mutter, staring up at him.

He snorts. "Brat, you really underestimate yourself, don't you? Sure, if we’re talking about Essence manipulation, you’re average at best. But your sword skills? They’re damn good. If you had some muscle to back it up, and a better Essence flow through your body, you might even give me a decent fight."

I shake my head, still catching my breath. "How do I improve my Essence flow?"

"For now? Stick with what I told you earlier," Ronan says, sheathing his sword with a smooth motion. "Essence flow isn’t something you fix with a shortcut. It grows naturally, along with your pool and your control. Yeah, there are some tricks... but why settle for a cheap shortcut when you can have the real thing?"

He ruffles my hair roughly, making me scowl.

"Keep at it. Don’t wander too far from camp, either. Even if that watcher isn’t hostile now, they can change their minds real fast."

I nod, still feeling the dull ache from his kick, and get back to training.

Ronan sits by the fire, sharpening his sword lazily. Aurora's already curled up inside the tent, nearly asleep.

I decide to keep him company for a while... and maybe later, catch a short power nap myself.

For the next three hours, I grinded through the training Ronan had assigned — switching arms, punching a thick wooden log, non-stop.

Essence flooding into my fists with every strike.

At first, it was manageable. But after a while, channeling the Essence started feeling like dragging a boulder uphill. My punches were slow. My arms shaking. Every breath felt heavier.

Still, I forced myself to keep going.

Eventually... somewhere in the middle of another weak, Essence-drained punch, my body gave up.

I slumped down against the log and drift into deep sleep without even realizing it — exhaustion pulled me under like a tide.

---

*A boy sits slumped in the far corner of a dim, broken room.*

*White hair tangled like a crow’s nest. Hands clutching the sides of his head, knuckles pale.*

*He rocks slightly, his lips moving — spilling out words I can’t catch, jumbled and broken, swallowed by the thick, heavy air.*

*Tears streak down his cheeks.*

*Not just sadness.*

*It’s anger too.*

*Something raw. Ugly. A kind of fear that twists inside the chest and makes breathing hurt.*

*I stand there, frozen, feeling like I shouldn't be seeing this. Like it's wrong.*

*But I can’t move. I can’t look away.*

*Who is he? Why am I seeing him?*

*I don't recognize the boy. I don’t recognize the place.*

*Nothing here belongs to me — and yet... it feels carved into my bones.*

*Before I can step forward, before I can even blink, the dream shatters around me — the whole scene tearing apart like paper caught in a storm.*

---

I jolt awake.

The morning sun already pokes through the trees.

My heart’s still hammering, breath shallow like I’ve just run a mile.

For a second, the dream clings to me — the boy, the room, that feeling — like fog that refuses to lift.

I sit up slowly, rubbing a hand over my face, trying to shove the weight of it away.

A bird calls somewhere high above, sharp and real. The world feels too bright, too loud.

No time to think. No time to process.

Ronan’s voice cuts through the haze.

"We’re moving out Summer, get ready!"

Still half-trapped between that dream and waking, I sling my pack handed by Ronan over my shoulder and fall into step.

The feeling of being watched hasn’t gone away. If anything, it’s thicker now — like a constant itch between my shoulder blades.

But why? We weren’t rich merchants dripping in gold. Hell, I looked more like a beggar than anything else.

Ronan’s group wasn't exactly flaunting richness either.

It didn’t make any damn sense. What could they possibly want from us?

"Today we’ll cover more distance" Ronan says over his shoulder.

Aurora frowns. "Why, Ronan? Is there a reason you want to push?"

He doesn’t answer.

Just tightens the strap across his chest and speeds up.

The pace he sets is brutal.

Three hours straight — no rest, no chatter, no breaks.

The world blurs into the crunch of boots on earth and the hot, rough wind scratching against my face.

And then I understood why he’s was rushing.

The presence that I’ve been sensing from this morning, it’s not the same presence from last night.

It’s different — heavier, rougher.

This one doesn't hide. I can feel their Essence leaking out like a wound, sharp and untrained.

There’s no way Ronan hasn't noticed it too.

I open my mouth to say something —

"Get behind Aurora, Summer."

Ronan's voice cuts through the air, sharp and fast.

"Aurora — northwest, three-forty. Behind the pair of trees. Left one."

No hesitation.

Just as the words leave Ronan’s mouth, a surge of light erupts behind the trees — a crystal glass spike blasting up from the ground.

Aurora’s attack. Clean and precise.

Without wasting a breath, Ronan dashes straight toward it — moving like a blur —

And then I see it.

A flash of motion.

A foot swinging out of nowhere —

Crack.

Ronan is kicked mid-air, sent flying backward with brutal force.

My heart lurches.

Three figures step out from behind the trees, surrounding us.

The first one looks ordinary enough — brown hair, plain clothes, an easy smile that doesn't reach his cold eyes. But his Essence pulses lightly around him, sharp and mean, like a hidden blade.

The second man moves into view — a mountain disguised as a man.

Broad shoulders, arms thick as ancient tree trunks, every step he takes makes the earth itself seem to recoil. His Essence rolls off him in crushing, suffocating waves — heavy enough to make my own knees twitch in instinctive fear, like the ground might split if he really tried. There’s no grace in him, no subtlety. Just raw, brutal force packed into a body built for destruction.

And the third —He’s almost the opposite. A wiry silhouette wrapped in a tattered cloak, his face lost in shadow. His Essence hums in the air, thin and sharp, like a blade hidden in mist, or a swarm of invisible insects crawling under the skin, waiting to sting. Looking at him sends a pulse of instinctive dread through my bones — not from his strength, but from something deeper.

A warning, ancient and primal, screaming: This one doesn't fight fair.

Even without a fight, it’s obvious —

The guy in the cloak and the giant one are dangerous, first’s dealable. 

I can't tell if they're the ones I spotted camping on the coastline — the ones I chased for days before crossing paths with Ronan and Aurora — or if these are strangers altogether and the part of me — the stupid, hopeful part — wonders if one of them is the same person who saved me in the cave.

I watch Ronan, someone way stronger than me, get thrown like a rag doll.

There’s no way in hell I’m surviving a solo fight against these guys.

Immediately I made sure to put some distance between us.

Ronan’s already back on his feet, grim and steady, while Aurora plants herself between us. He moves first as he launches forward in a straight blitz, Essence roaring off him like a storm. His fist, coated in blinding pure essence, slams directly into the first guy’s chest.

The impact is insane.

Man’s launched across the field, his body flipping mid-air before crashing hard into the dirt — unmoving. If he’s alive after that, it’s a miracle. But Ronan without wasting a second scans around as he plan to jump onto the next guy.

The other two guys finally move.

The cloaked one raises a hand, and a strange mist spills out from his fingers. At first it’s just a trickle, curling low to the ground. Then it spreads — thick, wet, swallowing the trees, the dirt, even the air itself.

Within seconds, we’re blinded. I can barely see my own hands, let alone Ronan or Aurora. I stumble, coughing, my instincts screaming. I could still feel their Essence but my eyes are useless now.

Chaos erupts.

Something heavy slams into the ground nearby.

A flash of movement.

A sharp gasp.

Aurora’s voice cuts through — desperate.

"Ro… Ronan! Summer — be careful, one of them is—"

She doesn’t finish.

Because in the next second —

A presence flashes right behind me.

I spin, too slow.

Thud.

A brutal punch slams straight into my gut.

All the air rips out of my lungs at once — pain blooming outwards in a shockwave. The world tilts. Darkness gnaws at the edges of my vision. If I hadn't instinctively coated my body with Essence just before, that hit would’ve ended me right there.

But even as I stagger, one thing burns brighter than the pain:

There’s no one there.

I look — frantic, desperate — but the space behind me is empty.

No footsteps. No shadow.

Nothing.

It’s like getting punched by a ghost.

What the hell is happening?
