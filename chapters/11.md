Chapter 11: Whispering Walls: Final Part

*“Hello, Summer,”* her voice echoed in my mind, soft and comforting. *“My baby brother is crying... what happened, Sun? Don’t cry.”*

I could feel her arms around me, holding me close, her warmth a blanket that shielded me from the cold of the world. I remembered how she always called me “Sun”.

*“What’s wrong, Sun? Talk to me,”* 

*“You know, I’ll always be here for you, right?”* 

*“If  something is bothering you because of me, I’m sorry, Summer, I’m sorry I let you down.”*

*“Don’t cry, Sun,”* her voice softened. *“Your sister will always be there for you.”*

*“I’ll always be here for you, no matter what…….”* 

A voice—soft, warm, and filled with love.

Celestia’s voice echoed in my mind, so vivid, so real. I could almost see her smile, feel her warmth, hear the gentle reassurance in her tone. But the moment shattered as reality came crashing down.

My eyes fluttered open, a blur of confusion clouding my vision. Tears welled up, the remnants of a dream that he couldn’t quite grasp lingering in my mind. Was it real? Or had it all been a fleeting illusion?

The pain had dulled into a numb, hollow sensation. My body felt like it was made of shattered glass, every movement sending waves of agony through me, but there was nothing left to break. My face was flushed, streaked with tears that fell without me even realizing it. Why was I crying? Was it the pain? Or was it something worse—the cruel reminder of everything I’d lost?

I swallowed hard, the lump in my throat burning like acid. My body was hanging on by a thread, but I pushed what was left of my aura through the wreckage of my limbs, desperate to summon even the smallest bit of strength. It felt like dragging myself through quicksand, but I didn’t have a choice. I couldn’t stop now. I wouldn’t.

So I walked.

I knew what was ahead. I knew it was just him—Draven. That monster, that twisted, sadistic creature who had taken everything from me. I knew there was no escape. No sudden miracle. No happy ending waiting to pull me from this hell.

But I kept moving.

Not because I hoped to find salvation. Not because I was defying fate.

But because in the depths of my broken mind, there was only one thought that refused to leave me: *I wish I could have one more dinner with my family.*

It was a stupid thought, I knew that. A useless, empty wish. But it was the only thing that kept me going, the only thing that anchored me to reality. The thought of seeing them all one more time—sitting at the table, laughing, eating… I clung to that like it was my lifeline.

So I walked.

Minutes turned into hours. Hours stretched into an eternity.

Twelve hours? Maybe more. Time was meaningless here. The cave was endless—just an unforgiving path of jagged rock and suffocating silence. My body screamed for rest, my throat was dry and raw from thirst, and every muscle felt like it was about to snap. But I couldn’t stop. I wouldn’t.

I had nothing left.

The world spun around me, everything blurring, my legs barely holding me up. My vision swam like a distorted painting, my aura—my very life—was hanging by a thread. I was on the edge, my body trembling, my breath shallow. If I collapsed now, it was over.

And then, just like before, just like in the castle, he appeared.

Draven.

Standing there.

I was too exhausted to react. My body refused to move, as if it had forgotten how to obey. Every inch of me was screaming for rest, but there was no comfort here. I wasn’t even shocked anymore—just… resigned. Resigned to this twisted game Draven played, to the inevitable end that loomed over me.

The silence pressed in, thick and suffocating, until Draven’s voice sliced through it—sharp, cruel, and dripping with amusement.

*“So… should I take your right arm this time? Or maybe your right arm and your remaining leg? I wonder how pathetic you’d look then.”*

His words were poison, meant to twist the knife deeper. I could feel his gaze burning into me, savoring every ounce of fear he’d already wrung out of me.

I should’ve been afraid. I should’ve been terrified, struggling, fighting, anything—but I was beyond that. His words didn’t even have the power to shock me anymore. They were just another cruel reminder of my helplessness, of how completely I had been broken.

Then I saw it—the way he raised his hand. Slow. Calculated. The flick of his wrist as he made a mocking, slow slashing motion through the air. The motion wasn’t just a threat—it was a taunt. A reminder of how little I mattered to him. How much he reveled in this. The way he toyed with me like I was nothing more than a plaything.

The raw, suffocating rage I’d buried deep inside me suddenly exploded.

Something inside me snapped. It was like a switch had been flipped, the remnants of my shattered will igniting in one final desperate surge of adrenaline. The instinct to survive—the flicker of life that had never fully extinguished—came rushing back.

My heart pounded, every ounce of pain in my body momentarily forgotten. I could feel the heat of it coursing through my veins, my mind sharpening, all my thoughts focused on one singular thing: survival.

And just as Draven faked his strike—too slow, too confident, too sure of his victory—something in me pushed back, a desperate instinct clawing at the edges of my consciousness, urging me to move.

**BOOM.**

Everything stopped.

I mean, *everything*.
