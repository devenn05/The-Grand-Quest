Chapter 3: The Forgotten Key to Reality

The world had changed, reshaped by an anomaly no one fully understood. Five thousand years ago, humanity was altered by the discovery of Primordium Evolution—an unexplained mutation caused by a bacterial phenomenon. At first, it seemed like a curse, warping human genetics unpredictably. But as generations passed, it became clear: this was evolution.

Not everyone was affected. Only 10% of the population carried the mutation, and among them, abilities varied wildly. Some could manipulate matter, forging materials from thin air or shaping the elements. Others refined their life force, transcending human limits with overwhelming physical prowess. But the rarest—those who could bend reality itself—were feared and misunderstood.

Satoshi, the scientist behind its discovery, had vanished decades ago, leaving behind only questions. But before he disappeared, he conducted experiments on the first known hosts of Primordium. Nine individuals, chosen or cursed, each displaying abilities unlike anything the world had seen before.

Eight of them became legends, pioneers of the new world. Their names were etched into history. The ninth, however, was forgotten. A failure, dismissed and left to rot. His name was Magnus Nox.

**Magnus Nox**, a university teacher, lived a routine life. At 26, single and dedicated to his work, he spent most of his days buried in books, researching, and engaging in deep discussions with like-minded individuals. His field of expertise—genetics and quantum biology—had earned him respect, but it was a chance encounter that would change his life forever.

It all started when he met Dr. Satoshi, a renowned scientist known for his radical theories on human evolution. Their paths crossed at a scientific symposium where Magnus, intrigued by a lecture on genetic mutations, had challenged one of the speakers. His insights caught Satoshi’s attention, and after the event, they spoke for hours about the potential of quantum organic catalysts—an uncharted area of genetic evolution.

“You see, Magnus, evolution as we know it is flawed,” Satoshi had said. “What if we could accelerate it? What if we could unlock abilities buried deep within our DNA?”

Magnus was fascinated. Unlike the skeptics who dismissed Satoshi as a madman, he saw the potential in his research. Weeks later, he was offered a position on Satoshi’s team—a chance to work on something that could change the course of humanity and he took it, he started working for Satoshi and have been working under him for now past 2 months.

One fine day, Magnus was in his lab working around quantum organic catalysts—a potential breakthrough in human evolution. The lab was alive with activity, machines humming, researchers moving between workstations. Magnus adjusted his gloves, reviewing the calculations one last time before proceeding with the experiment.

Then it happened.

A containment breach. The alarms screamed through the facility. Magnus barely had time to react before a wave of energy engulfed him. His vision turned white, a searing heat tearing through his body. He gasped, trying to move, but the pain was unbearable.

Then—darkness.

When he woke up, he wasn’t in the lab anymore.

Lying in the closed cell, Magnus opened his eyes in confusion, his mind clouded. He couldn’t recall what had happened—only the blaring alarms, the searing pain, and then… nothing. Now, he was here, trapped in an unfamiliar, sterile room with no windows, no escape.

A speaker crackled to life.

"Magnus, remain calm," Satoshi’s voice echoed through the room. "You’ve been exposed to quantum organic catalysts. We need to monitor your condition. Stay put."

But Satoshi was lying.

The lab breach wasn’t an accident. It had been orchestrated from the very beginning. Magnus wasn’t just an unfortunate victim—he was a test subject. Along with him, thirty-five others had been chosen, each with different genetic structures and biological compositions. Satoshi needed to see how the catalyst would affect them.

Weeks passed. Magnus lay there, his body weakening, his mind deteriorating. No changes, no abilities—nothing. He was failing, just another discarded experiment. Of the thirty-six subjects, only nine had survived the catalyst’s effects. The rest? Dead, their bodies unable to handle the mutation.

But the remaining eight had developed something extraordinary. Some could create and manipulate matter; others refined their life force to enhance themselves. It was undeniable—quantum organic catalysts were the key to unlocking human evolution.

Except for Magnus.

He exhibited no physical manifestations, no essence manipulation. Nothing to show for what he had endured. He was deemed useless, a failed experiment. Satoshi had no choice but to abandon him. Yet, he couldn’t risk releasing him either. So, Magnus was left in isolation, left to die.

Days passed. Hunger gnawed at him, his body barely clinging to life. His mind teetered on the edge of oblivion. But in those final moments—**something awakened.**

As he lay on the cold floor, delirious, a question lingered in his fading thoughts: *Had the catalyst truly done nothing to him? Or had something happened that he simply couldn’t comprehend?*

Then, a shockwave pulsed through his skull.

A vision—an experience unlike anything he had ever known. Reality itself bent at his will, fluctuating like an ocean caught in a storm. He felt it, not as a force, but as an extension of his very existence. He wasn’t just affected by the catalyst. He had become something beyond it.

And in that moment, Magnus did something—**something no one could explain.**

Days later, when they found his lifeless form, the room was no longer the same. The walls bore faint, shifting patterns, as though rewritten by an unseen force. No one knew what had transpired, what Magnus had glimpsed before his end.

But in his hands, he clutched a simple, unassuming **diary.**

At the time, no one recognized its importance. Just a book. Just words. But buried within its pages lay the **blueprint for something far greater.** A secret waiting to be uncovered.
