Chapter 10: Whispering Walls: Part II

The pain was so overwhelming that I couldn't even process the horrifying reality—my arm was completely torn off. Blood gushed from the wound, pooling beneath me in a sickening crimson flood. It was a torrent I couldn’t escape, soaking into the cold, unforgiving stone beneath me. I couldn't feel anything but the searing agony, every nerve in my body screaming in protest, and yet there was nothing I could do but lie there, suffering. I was helpless. Completely. Utterly helpless.

Minutes passed. Maybe hours. Time felt irrelevant, like it had warped into some strange, unrecognizable thing. I couldn’t tell how long I’d been here, how long I’d been drifting in and out of consciousness, caught in the agony of it all.

Summoning what little strength I had left, I gathered every ounce of willpower and forced my aura into the gaping wound. The sensation was almost worse than the pain itself—my energy coursing through me, crawling into the torn flesh, desperately trying to seal the veins, trying to stop the bleeding. The pain was unbearable, a constant, unrelenting ache that threatened to swallow me whole, but I had no choice. I knew I couldn’t just let it take me. I clenched my teeth so hard I thought they might crack, my muscles trembling with the effort, refusing to let my consciousness slip away. My vision swam, the edges of everything going blurry and distorted, but I fought it. Slowly, ever so slowly, my breathing steadied, each breath feeling like a battle in itself.

After what felt like an eternity, I regained a sliver of composure—just enough to push through the next hurdle. My body screamed in protest, each movement a fresh wave of torment. But I couldn’t stop. I had to move. Had to do something—anything to get out of this hell.

My eyes darted around the cave, desperate for some kind of answer, some way out. I couldn’t afford to stay here. I had to find something, some way to keep going. And then, in the distance, I spotted it—a narrow path winding deeper into the darkness, the same route Draven had taken when he left. My heart pounded in my chest. It was a lifeline, or at least it could be. But then, a new thought struck me, sharp and cold.

Why had he left me here?

If Draven had wanted me dead, there was no reason for him to leave me alive. No reason at all. And yet, here I was—bleeding out, broken, but alive. This wasn’t a mercy. This wasn’t a mistake. It was a game. He was playing with me. I was nothing more than a pawn to him, a tool in whatever twisted game he had going on in that mind of his. The realization hit me like a stone to the chest, heavy and suffocating. Draven had no reason to keep me alive, and that meant one thing—he was watching. Waiting.

But I didn’t have the luxury of thinking about it for too long. I had no choice. There was only one thing I could do now. I had to move forward. There was no other option.

So, despite the pain, despite the exhaustion threatening to pull me under, I forced my body to take the first step. My legs trembled beneath me, my movements shaky and uneven. But I kept going. One step, then another, each footfall sending a jolt of pain up my spine. I didn’t stop. I couldn’t.

For half an hour, I walked. The silence of the cave pressed in on me, suffocating. Every breath I took felt like it might be my last, my chest tightening with every inhale. The only sound that broke the silence was the rasp of my breathing, the quiet echo of my labored steps. And yet, despite the agony that coursed through me, I couldn’t stop. Not yet. Then suddenly,

Laughter.

A cruel, mocking laugh.

Draven stood ahead, leaning casually against the cave wall, his crimson eyes gleaming with amusement.

*“Hahaha! I knew you’d come,”* he sneered. *“I was waiting for you.”* He licked his lips, his fangs glinting in the dim light. *“I got hungry again… maybe this time, I’ll take one of the legs.”*

Hearing that surged panic within me, and I instantly started acting. I was about to move away from him, rambling random things. *“N-no… please, not again,”* I stammered, my voice trembling. *“Why don’t you just kill me? That—”*

Before I could even finish, a streak of energy sliced through the air.

I barely registered the pain, but before I knew it, my left leg was severed from my body.

The world tilted. My vision blurred. The shock was instant, but the pain—the pain—was beyond anything I had ever experienced.

A guttural scream tore from my throat, raw and agonizing. My body convulsed, my hands clawing at the ground, desperate for something—anything—to hold on to.

Draven caught the severed limb through a void portal, bringing it close. He inspected it for a moment before taking a bite.

Then, with a look of disgust, he spat it out and tossed the leg back onto me.

*“Ugh. This is shit.”* He clicked his tongue, his expression filled with disdain. *“Maybe I should’ve taken the other arm instead.”*

I thrashed on the ground, my cries of agony filling the cavern. My body trembled violently, my mind on the verge of collapse. My breathing came in short, ragged gasps, my senses drowning in unbearable torment.

I couldn’t take it.

My vision darkened.

And then—

Everything faded to black.

Draven let out an annoyed sigh, clicking his tongue. *“Tch. Passed out already?”* He shook his head, turning away. *“Boring.”*

With that, he disappeared into the shadows, leaving me lying there—unconscious, broken, and bleeding out onto the cold, unforgiving stone.
