"We're heading to a city called Silverlake, northwest of Bahaman. If you..."

I immediately cut in, surprised, "Bahaman?"

I kind of expected it to be either Bahaman or Arland. I really hoped for Arland because it would have been much easier going back to Lunaris. Arland is a developed country, while Bahaman... well, it's the country of Beastkins. They usually reside in forests and aren’t very friendly toward Humans.

"Yes, Bahaman. Are you not from Bahaman?"

"Lunaris. I'm from Lunaris. Anyway, what’s your name?"

Taking a glance at the elf beside him, he said, "My name is Ronan, and she is Aurora. As you can see, she’s an Elf, and me? I’m a proud Beastkin."

"Well, that explains your physique! My name’s Summer, Summer Williams. I’m Human," I said dryly.

"We can’t help you reach any port, but we're traveling north through Bahaman to a village known as Silverlake. You could come with us till there if you want. From Silverlake, there are known routes through the forests leading straight to the capital. The forest is dense, but the paths are well-traveled now. From the capital, it should be easy to find transport back to Lunaris. Heading south would take you forever, especially since Arland’s ports are temporarily closed due to the conflict between Avalon and Obsedia."

"That’d be great, Ronan. I’d really appreciate it if you could do that for me."

"What is your Primordium stage?"

Well, that was a tricky question. They might decide to abandon me here if they thought I was useless baggage. I had seen them defeat those Howlers like they were ants. The elf girl, Aurora, was definitely mid-Ember stage. Compared to her, I was barely mid-Kindle, and we almost looked the same age.

And Ronan... yeah, he’s damn strong. Stronger than my father. I could feel his Essence clearly. His pool is monstrous.

"I'm a Manipulator, early mid-Kindle stage. I'm fourteen."

No way in hell was I going to tell them about the Spatial Realm. I just hoped they wouldn't interfere or interrogate me any further about it.

"Well, a year older than my friend’s pupil here. She’s thirteen and a Manifestor. Although she's a stage above you—half-Ember. And me? I'm at the Ascendant stage. As for the sub-stage, let’s just keep it a secret for now. I’m sure you also don't want us interfering with your Primordium. I asked because if we’re going to be traveling together, it’s better to know how to make use of your abilities. As for how I knew you had Primordium—" he shrugs, "it wasn’t hard to guess. This coastline might not be crawling with creatures, but no ordinary person could survive here for a month. Barely any food, barely any shelter. If you lasted this long, you had to be a Primordium user."

I gave a fake smile and nodded.

"So who kidnapped you? How the heck did you end up traveling from Lunaris to Bahaman, almost from the center of Avalon?"

Should I tell them about the vampire? Or should I not?

A couple of seconds passed as I stayed silent.

Just as I was about to speak, Ronan said, "It’s okay if you don’t want to tell. It just sounds very unrealistic anyway. I'll stop pushing. If it’s true, you must be pretty traumatized by all of this—almost a month of walking by yourself."

"I know it sounds unrealistic. But I'm telling you guys the truth. Although I can’t go into specifics, one thing’s completely true—I’ve been away from Lunaris for almost a month now. My parents... I can’t even imagine what they must be feeling. A whole month without any sign from me... they probably think I’m dead by now."

"Let’s take a break for now. We’re also tired after that Howler ambush, and you’ve been walking for a long time."

Saying this, we headed toward the mountains.

Finding a spot under the trees’ shade, with the shallow forest around us and a mountain looming on one side, we settled down to rest.

Food! Real food! They have real edible food. My eyes spark as Ronan pulls out smoked fish and some kind of sauce or curry from a small storage container.

“Here, you can have this,” he says, handing me two smoked fish with that sauce.

I almost cry tears of joy. The elven girl lets out a small chuckle, immediately returning to her usual silence.

“She’s not very talkative, is she?”

“Yeah, say that once she gets to know you better. She’s a certified yapper.”

“Ronan, I’m not,” she mutters.

I can feel the bond between them.

“So what are you guys doing out here? I assume there’s no civilization or any city near the coastline.”

“You’re correct, Summer. There are no cities anywhere near the coastline. We’ve been on a search. My comrade is missing. We’ve been looking for him.”

I had a lot of questions, but I kept them to myself. It wasn’t my place to pry.

“So, you said you saw a campfire three weeks ago, right? Can you tell us exactly what you saw, Summer?”, Ronan asked.

How do I tell them I also saw a camp just last night? That was the only reason I started running in this direction.

“Yeah. I saw a fire on my first day after my abduction. I was up in the mountains and saw a campfire near the coastline. By the time I climbed down and got close, they had already left. The only thing left behind were two logs they must’ve used to sit on, some food waste, fishbones, and a bit of leftover fried fish.”

“Oh, I see. Can’t really make much of that, but we didn’t encounter anyone. Certainly not a group of three. We’ve been traveling this route for almost two months now. Crossed two ports to the south. All dead closed. Barely interacted with anyone. If they really were walking along the coastline, by now we would’ve already bumped into them. My guess is they ascended the mountains and either went inland or headed south through the peaks.”

“That’s the only answer I can think of, Ronan. Anyway, I’m really grateful I ran into you guys. Even though I was chasing someone else, I’m lucky I found someone to help me out. And just in time too. If you weren’t there and the Howlers ambushed me instead... I would've been dead for sure.”

Ronan smiles and nods at me. Aurora has a little blush on her face.

We talk as we eat. Yeah—tasty fucking food. I didn’t even know what type of sauce it was, but it was definitely a masterpiece!

After some time, we decide to start walking north, the way I originally came from. It’s still noon. The sun’s starting to dip lower.

“So, Summer, where are you from in Lunaris?”

“I’m from Riverton. My father’s a noble there. He’s also a strong fighter—a master Manipulator!”

“That’s great. I’d love to meet him. Right now, I’d like to give him an earful, though. How’d he let his son get abducted?” Ronan says jokingly. I can tell he means no harm.

“Aurora, why don’t you tell him something about yourself?” Ronan asks.

“Me... Wh-What about myself?”

Ronan laughs.

“Why don’t you tell him about your Primordium? He already saw it yesterday. I’ll tell you what—she’s an excellent Manifestor. In the future, she’s going to surpass me easily, Summer.”

I kind of catch on that Ronan is teasing Aurora as she starts getting flustered. With a smirk, I join in.

“I don’t have any doubt. I did see her in action. I would never make an enemy out of you, Aurora.”

“What... No. It’s just—I had a better master teaching me and a somewhat decent Essence pool. I’m definitely not that special. In fact, my master was probably way better than me at my age.”

"Ah, stop that. I don't know what Julian told you, but he wasn't anywhere near your level at your age. He's probably just showing off. I'd say he had about half your Essence pool back then, and that's only because he’s a Beastkin."

Aurora pouts, a bit annoyed.

“Nooo, Ronan. Master would never lie to me.”

“I feel sad for you, girl, if you think that.”

I can really feel the bond between them. And in that moment, without thinking much, I ask something I shouldn’t have.

“So, where is your master now, Aurora?”

Instantly, the mood around us drops.

Ronan is the first to break the silence.

“Remember when I told you we’re searching for my friend? Yeah. Her master is the one I was talking about. His name’s Julian. He’s also Aurora’s sole guardian.”

I really am trash, aren’t I? Not only did I force her to think about her missing master, but I also made Ronan explain it all to me.

“I’m sorry, Aurora. I didn’t—”

She cuts me off.

“It’s okay, Summer. It’s not like he’s gone forever. We’ll find him. I’m sure he just went on his own adventure. I guess he was always pinned down because of me.”

I feel even worse. She’s trying to convince herself with reasons that are probably not true.

“Cheer up, girl. We’ll find that roach. He’s not getting away that easily,” Ronan says, trying to lift her spirits.

With new boundaries in mind, we talk and talk until the sun almost sets. That’s when we decide to camp for the night.

Ronan actually had a freakin' tent stuffed in his bag. How many things was he carrying around anyway? Not that difficult when you have that big of a body, I guess.

He asked me to collect some wood from around the area while he started setting up the tent. Aurora went over to help him without needing to be asked.

I scouted around, picking up whatever wood I could find for the fire. Still... for some reason, I kept feeling like someone was watching me. But honestly, way out here, deep in the forest?

It couldn’t be possible.

Creatures and animals wouldn’t be a problem — and even a Mossback would have a hard time dealing with that mighty seven-foot goliath we had with us.

So I ignored the feeling and moved on.

When I made it back, I saw Aurora pulling supplies from her bag. It was time to eat again. Man, I was loving this. What did I even do to get so lucky? Once again, roasted fish with that sauce. To be honest, I could never get enough of it. After a proper dinner, I decided to move away from the camp for a bit. Not too far, but enough to be on my own for a while.

I hadn’t trained all day, and I didn’t want to lose the progress I’d been making.

I started channeling my Essence into my arms, just like before. As I focused, I heard Ronan’s voice from behind me.

"You practicing your manipulation?"

"Yeah," I said, not stopping. "I’ve been doing this for almost a month now. I know I’m weak... but I don't plan on staying that way. I don’t know what I’ll be facing in the future, so I figured better now than never. I trained back in Lunaris too. I actually had one of the best teachers I could’ve hoped for... but I didn’t really take advantage of it. I was lazy back then."

Ronan let out a short chuckle and smiled, "It's usually in times of adversity that people start realizing the value of self-improvement. Good thing it's still within reach for you."

He stepped closer, watching me.

"But... if you want some advice, I wouldn't train Essence the way you're doing it right now.
Yeah, it’ll work, but the progress will be way too slow."

I looked up, curious.

"Instead," he said, "try punching something while hardening your hand. I get it — maintaining Essence while attacking isn’t easy, but it’s way more effective.
Take it from someone who's also a Manipulator."

I nodded.

It made sense.

Not sure why I didn’t think of it myself. As I was about to get back to it, he suddenly grinned and asked, "So who's your teacher? Your father?"

"No, actually," I said. "I haven’t trained under him yet. Our butler, Alfred, taught me.
When I was around ten or eleven, Zane tried to teach me too... but honestly, I couldn’t really keep up with him."

At the mention of Zane, Ronan’s eyebrows shot up.

"Zane? You mean Zane Nolan? The ex-commander of Avalon?"

"Yeah, that's the one."

"Damn," Ronan muttered. "You were under his tutelage? You should've absorbed every bit you could.
The guy’s a legend. Are you a swordsman too?"

"Yeah," I said. "Even though my Essence manipulation is below average... I do have decent sword skills."

Ronan gave me a smirk.

"Then let’s have a friendly spar!"
