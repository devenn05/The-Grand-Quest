I was born into an ordinary human family in Emberfall—country in the heart of Obsedia. My parents, Raven and Drake, were kind, humble people. No Primordium, no powers. Just decent lives and honest work. And then there was me—**Draven**.

I wasn’t born ordinary.

At ten, my Primordium awakened. Not just any kind, I awakened to be a Reality Influencer. I could tear through space. I could warp. 

I was naïve enough to think it’d change things for the better. I wanted more for myself, for my family. So I made a vow, I’d climb. I’d grow strong. I’d reach the top.

I set my sights on Legion Clan—one of the Eight Great Clans ruling Obsedia. The ones who also ruled Emberfall itself.

For three years, I trained like a man possessed. Every waking hour. No breaks. My talent caught attention fast. Smaller clans tried to recruit me. I refused them all. I wanted Legion.

At fifteen, they came knocking. I joined in without hesitation.

We moved closer to their headquarters. I became their youngest official member. My parents were proud—so proud.

That’s when I met him.

Cain.

One of Legion’s top officers. Respected. Feared. A vampire. 

At first, things were... normal. I was assigned missions, trained harder, climbed ranks. My primordium made me invaluable—quick strikes, rescues, recon. Cain watched, and eventually took me under himself and also offered to train me.

He pushed me past limits I didn’t know I had. Taught me precision, movement, strategy, anatomy. How to kill, and how to never be caught doing it. I became more than just a member. I became his weapon.

Then came the research program.

It wasn’t voluntary. High-command picked candidates. Cain backed it, so I obeyed. They injected me with some kind of serum. A serum meant to mutate Primordium—create a hybrid evolution. I didn’t feel different after, eventually they ruled it as failure cause no changes were recorded in any of the volunteers.

That lie shattered everything.

What I found out later was this all was Illegal experimentation. Forbidden mutations. 

War erupted as other clans found out.

Then the Council issued their verdict: Execute all subjects. No trials. No exceptions. If Legion refused, they’d be wiped off the map.

I was on that list.

I heard the news early, through contacts. I fled. I wanted to take my parents, but I thought they’d be safe if they stay away from all of this, from me.

I was wrong.

Legion took them. Tortured them. Executed them publicly. Their mutilated bodies were displayed in Emberfall’s square. Their heads on iron spikes.

I died that day. Not physically. Not yet.

I was caught within a week. I didn’t run. I had no mental strength left.

They dragged me in chains blocking my essence off back to the Legion stronghold—the place I once worshipped. And waiting for me… was Cain.

There I found out that it was Cain behind all of this.

Rage. Grief. Horror. It all collapsed into a single, blinding moment. I lunged at him. No Essence. No weapon. Just fists. He didn’t flinch. I landed one scratch across his face. That was all.

He slammed me into the wall. Bones cracked. Blood spilled. He stood over me, tracing the blood on his cheek.

That scratch—the last act of a dying man—would change everything.

The next morning, I was taken to the Obsedian Abyss. Shackled. Choked. A soldier raised a sword.

One clean swing at my heart. Darkness as i fall into the abyss.

But that didn’t kill.

I woke up choking on seawater, washed onto a desolate shore. My body broken. My mind worse. Wondering how I was still alive, I got my answer. The small skewed fight with Cain, changed my whole body. Fangs, sharp eyes, cold body. I could sense that his blood had fused with mine.

That was how I became a half-vampire.

And that mutation finally broke. The serum they ruled it as failure it worked. That was how I awakened a second Primordium.

I didn’t care what it meant. I just wanted my revenge. I wandered, starved, hunted. My hunger turned to violence. I lost control as I started killing citizens in Arland—one of the country in Avalon  hoping to find way back to Obsedia cause I was way far away from my continent. The Obsedian Abyss had brought me to a foreign Continent. I turned Arland upside down, and that’s when he found me.

Zefir. A swordsman.

He defeated me with a blade of sacred oak. Pierced my chest. Sealed me in a nameless cave between life and death.

But I knew that wasn’t the end.

---

I open my eyes.

How long has it been? Years? Decades?

"You’re free now", A voice calls to me, soft and strange. A figure stands at the mouth of the cave—beastkin. In his hand, the oakwood stake that kept me trapped.

"Let’s go, Julian. She’s not here.", another beastkin standing next to him spoke.

*Julian.* That’s his name.

Why? Why did he do it? Why did he removed the oak blade?

A thousand questions flood my mind, but my body won’t respond. I'm too weak to move, too drained from the years of nothingness. I watch them walk away, their silhouettes fading until they vanish completely.

But one truth burns brighter than the rest:, I'm free.

Eventually, I crawl out of that nameless cave, step into sunlight I’d nearly forgotten, and begin walking. Wandering. Breathing.
