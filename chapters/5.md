Chapter 5: Crucial Decisions

Lucian’s fingers stopped drumming against the armrest, his gaze sharpening. "*A dual-nexus user? Are you talking about **Elysia Wells**?*", Cedric gave a subtle nod, his expression unreadable. The weight of that revelation hung between them, and for the first time in their conversation, Cedric saw something new in Lucian’s eyes—interest.  After a moment of silence, he spoke, his voice measured. “*Let me speak with Celestia and Lillian first. I need to hear their thoughts before making a decision.*”

Dual Nexus User—someone capable of wielding two out of the three Primordium. They were rare, almost mythical, with only a handful known across the entire kingdom of Avalon. That one of them—an Archmage, no less—would be teaching his daughter was no small matter. Lucian felt a storm of emotions rise within him. Excitement, because this was an unparalleled opportunity. Worry, because the road ahead would not be easy. Happiness, because Celestia was growing stronger. And sadness... because he knew this was a path where she’ll pace a fair share of  difficulties, pain and struggle.

At dawn, Lucian and Celestia prepared to depart for Riverton. Celestia and Stephanie shared their goodbyes, their usual playful banter tinged with something softer—an unspoken understanding that things were about to change. Stephanie, following Cedric’s orders, refrained from mentioning her upcoming expedition. If Lucian refused the offer, Celestia’s stubbornness would undoubtedly create trouble.

As they rode away from Dunford, Celestia cast one last glance back at the towering walls of the Vale estate, her thoughts lingering on her friend. The road back to Riverton stretched before them, but for Celestia, it felt like something had shifted—like she was stepping toward something new, even if she didn’t yet know what.

## Departure of Celestia

 

The next day, Father sat with Mother in their private chamber, sunlight spilling through the windows. He must’ve expected her to be against it because he looked kind of tense, but she just listened. No interrupting, no arguing—just sitting there, thinking.

Then, finally, she let out a quiet sigh. "*She’s strong, Lucian. Maybe even stronger than we realize.*" She tapped her fingers against the table, her face unreadable. "*I know you want to protect her. I do too. But we can’t shelter her forever.*"

Father ran a hand through his hair, looking frustrated. "*I just—*" He hesitated, which wasn’t like him. "*I don’t want her to go through what we did.*"

Mother reached over, resting her hand on his. "*I know,*" she said softly. "*But you’ve always said Celestia has fire in her heart. If we hold her back, we’ll only smother it. This is her chance to grow.*"

Father frowned, clearly not liking it. But in the end, he just sighed and nodded. "*Then it’s decided.*"

Later that evening, Celestia was called into the grand hall. Both of them were already there, sitting in silence, looking at her with unreadable expressions. The whole atmosphere was heavy, like something big was about to happen.

"*I'll get straight to the point, Cel,*" Father finally said, his voice calm but firm. "*You already know how much potential you have. Your affinity hasn’t developed yet, but your aura control is ahead of your peers.*" He paused, tapping his fingers on the armrest. "*I’ve found a teacher for you. Not me—someone Cedric Vale arranged. She’s a dual nexus user, and she’ll be leaving for the capital next week with his daughters. He asked if you want to go with them.*"

Then, he leaned forward slightly, his golden eyes sharp.

"*I don’t want you to go.*"

Celestia’s breath caught for a second, but Father wasn’t done.

"*I’ve always wanted to give you a life without struggles. To keep you happy, safe, away from the burdens this path brings. Because make no mistake, Cel—this road is full of hardship and pain. And if I can shield you from that, I will.*"

His voice wavered, just for a second. Then he took a slow breath and steadied himself.

"*But I also know you,*" he continued. "*Since you were little, you’ve been relentless—always chasing strength, always pushing past your limits. And no matter how much I want to hold you back, I know that fire inside you won’t let you stay still.*"

He rubbed his temples, exhaling, before meeting her gaze again.

"*So I’ll ask this only once. Do you want to go?* It’s an incredible opportunity, but I won’t lie to you—it won’t be easy."

Celestia was quiet for a moment. Then she smiled, that spark in her eyes—the one that always meant trouble—lighting up. "*I’ll think about it and tell you tomorrow, Daddy.*"

Her voice was playful, but I could tell she had already decided.

"*I know you worry too much,*" she added, stretching her arms dramatically. "*But I don’t want to be a weak, boring sister to Summer—I want to be a cool one!*"

*You’re already cool as a cucumber, Celi. Why’d you have to do that?*" anyways this won’t change anything,

Father shook his head, a quiet chuckle escaping him. "*You’re already cool, Cel,*" he muttered.

"*Still,*" she grinned, "*I’ll take the night to decide. No rush, right?*"

But she wasn’t fooling anyone.

The next morning, before the sun was even fully up, she marched straight into Father’s study.

"*I’m going,*" she announced, all confidence.

Father barely reacted, like he already knew. Which, knowing him, he probably did. He just leaned back in his chair with a small sigh. "*I figured as much,*" he said, amused. "*I sent word to Cedric last night.*"

Celestia blinked, surprised for half a second, before smirking. "*You really do know me too well, huh?*"

Father chuckled. "*Better than you think.*"

When Stephanie got the news, she was *way* too excited, practically bouncing in place. "*Finally! She’s coming with us!*" she cheered, clapping her hands together.

She had been hoping Celestia would join them, but with how protective Father was, it wasn’t a sure thing. Now that it was, she couldn’t wait.

Meanwhile, Lord Cedric had already started planning. He had official business in the capital anyway, so he’d be traveling with them. "*Might as well make use of the trip,*" he muttered, flipping through papers. But something about his expression said he knew this journey was going to be more than just business.
