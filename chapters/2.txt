# Volume 1: Shadows of Tomorrow.

### Summer’s POV

I am Summer Williams, son of Lucian Williams, the Patriarch of the Williams family, and Lillian Williams. And, of course, the younger brother of the legendary Reaper Fang. At just ten years old, I am as unremarkable as one could be—or at least, that’s what I believed. That’s what everyone believed.

My Essence Manipulation is painfully average, devoid of any special traits. I trained under ex-Commander Zane for two years, making some progress, but nothing extraordinary. Zane taught me everything—the fundamentals, the theories, the principles of combat. But when it came to actual battle application, my growth stalled. I never advanced beyond basic aura coating, nor did I awaken an elemental affinity. In a world where prodigies shape history, even those merely above average leave me in their shadow. I was just another apple in the orchard—one that no one would pick first.

But what I didn’t know… was that fate had already set its plans in motion.

11 YEARS AGO,

Avalon—a continent of towering mountains, rushing rivers, and endless green. Half of its land meets the untamed ocean, while the other half stretches into vast forests, fertile plains, and landscapes steeped in ancient history. Within this world, 17 nations thrive, each shaped by power and mystery. Among them, Lunaris, the Nation of Peace, stands proud. It is ruled by three great noble families—Everhart, Vale, and Williams—each governing distinct regions of the country. 

These noble families stand at the pinnacle of Lunaris’ hierarchy, each shaping the realm through their distinct legacies.

The Vale family, rulers of Dunford, the largest of the Three Domains, commands both fear and respect. Renowned for their unparalleled military prowess, they have produced generations of elite warriors and master tacticians, solidifying their dominance on the battlefield.

The Everhart family, sovereigns of Lucial, has established itself as the undisputed authority in medicine and alchemy. Pioneering breakthroughs in healing techniques and disease treatment, they serve as the lifeline of Lunaris, ensuring the well-being of its people.

The Williams family, masters of one of the three Primordium types—Essence Manipulation, govern Riverton, the economic heart of Lunaris. Through generations of rigorous study, they have transcended normal human limits, wielding Primordium Essence, the fundamental energy that defines existence itself. Their mastery transforms raw life energy into unparalleled power, all while ensuring that trade, wealth, and influence remain firmly within their grasp.

At the core of Avalon’s power—no, the very foundation of the world itself—lies Primordium, the essence that fuels all life and abilities. Those who can manipulate Primordium tap into an energy that defies natural laws, granting them strength beyond imagination. The Williams family stands at the forefront of this mastery, focusing on harnessing, refining, and evolving the Primordium essence . While other noble houses excel in warfare, medicine, or politics, my family dedicates itself to unlocking the deeper secrets of existence itself. Among the elite, only those with awakened Primordium affinities are deemed worthy of holding positions in noble houses. From the head butler to the elite guards, every servant in our estate possesses Primordium blood, ensuring their place among the strongest. Some could shape their essence into sheer raw power, some could bend reality with their will, while others could infuse it into objects and materials, turning the ordinary into the extraordinary. 

My father, Lucian Williams, the newely appointed Patriarch, is a name known across Avalon. A master strategist and Essence manipulator, he played a pivotal role in the Lanka War, leading his forces to decisive victories. Under his leadership, our family rose from mere Counts to the esteemed rank of Marquesses, a testament to his brilliance and ambition. My mother, Lillian Williams, hails from the Vale family, an exceptional Primordium user and a rare Material Nexus Manifestor. Her abilities defied expectations, allowing her to reshape the battlefield in ways no ordinary user could. Together, with the backing of powerful allies and loyal servants, they forged a dynasty that reshaped Lunaris power balance.

At just seven years old, my sister, Celestia Williams, had already begun to display remarkable talent in Essence Manipulation. A true prodigy, she started manifesting power that could surpassed even seasoned warriors, her potential was widely acknowledged among Lunaris’ elite. Compared to her… Compared to her, I was—and still am—a joke. But it was around that time…

### March 26th

The Williams family eagerly awaited the arrival of their newest member, set to be born within the week. Preparations were in full swing, with Head Butler Alfred ensuring every necessity for the newborn was arranged.

However, the atmosphere within the estate had been anything but peaceful. For the past couple of weeks, unsettling rumors had been spreading—whispers of a Walking Calamity, a Reality Influencer, one of the three types of Primordium users, lurking within the territory. At first, the misfortunes seemed like mere coincidences—minor illnesses, business failures, unexpected accidents. But as days passed, the pattern became too precise to ignore. People fell ill without cause, wealth vanished overnight, and lives were lost in ways that defied logic.

It didn’t take long for the Williams household to recognize the signs. This wasn’t random misfortune—it was the work of a Reality Influencer, a being capable of distorting fate itself. Under Lucian’s direct orders, the estate tightened security, and an active search for the intruder was launched.

Days later, at the break of dawn, an unexpected visitor arrived at the castle, claiming to be a friend of Lillian Williams. Alfred, the ever-dutiful butler, found no recollection of her yet remained courteous, seating her in the waiting hall while he informed Lillian. Upon hearing the name, Lillian hesitated but ultimately instructed Alfred to bring her in the castle hall, Celestia was also present.

As the woman stepped inside, Lillian felt an unease she couldn’t explain. Something about her presence felt... off. Just as she was about to speak, a sudden, piercing scream shattered the air.

It was Celestia.

The young girl stood trembling, her wide eyes locked onto the guest, her breath ragged. Lillian and Alfred turned to her, confused—until they realized something terrifying.

Though still a child, Celestia was a budding Essence Manipulator, more attuned to the unseen forces than most. Unlike Lillian and Alfred, who were Manifesters and relied on physical manifestation of Primordium, Celestia could sense the raw, intangible essence in its purest form. And what she felt in that moment was something vile. Something wrong.

Before anyone could react, the woman—who had introduced herself as Sasha—lunged at Lillian with unmistakable killing intent.

Pure instinct took over.

Celestia moved first.

In a flash, she threw herself between her mother and Sasha, pushing the attacker back before she could make contact. But in that split second, Sasha’s fingertips brushed against Celestia’s arm.

A moment too late.

Alfred, stationed at the entrance, sprang into action. His blade was already drawn, its edge engulfed in flames. Without hesitation, he struck.

A single clean motion.

Sasha’s head rolled onto the floor.

A heavy silence followed. Lillian stood frozen, struggling to process what had just happened. Nearby, Celestia swayed, her adrenaline surge fading as unconsciousness took her. Alfred, ever composed, immediately summoned the guards. Within moments, a dozen armed men stormed into the room.

Then, Lucian arrived.

His eyes swept over the scene—his wife in shock, his daughter collapsed, and the lifeless body of the intruder sprawled before them. A storm brewed beneath his calm exterior. Suppressing his rising fury, he demanded an explanation.

Alfred recounted every detail.

By the time Lucian finished listening, the truth had settled in. The Walking Calamity had infiltrated their home, and it had come dangerously close to succeeding in its attack. The threat was eliminated, yet something still felt unresolved.

As the maids rushed in to tend to Celestia and console Lillian, no one paid attention to the brief, fleeting touch that had passed between Sasha and Celestia.
In the wake of the unsettling incident, young Celestia was plagued by restless nights, her sleep fractured by lingering fear. For nearly a week, she remained uneasy, haunted by shadows of the past, before gradually settling back into her usual self.

A week later, the horror of that night faded into memory, overshadowed by the joy of new life.

The Williams family gathered once more, not in fear, but in celebration—for the birth of their newest member.

---

## April 1st

Just as summer brings warmth, growth, and boundless energy, the birth of Baby Summer filled the Williams family with immense joy. His arrival symbolized vitality and renewal, much like the season he was named after.

On April 1st, the news of Baby Summer's birth spread, bringing joy not only to the Williams domain but across the entire land of Lunaris. Lucian Williams personally chose the name Summer for his son, a name meant to embody warmth, strength, and the promise of a bright future.

To mark this auspicious occasion, the Williams family planned a grand naming ceremony and reception in upcoming week. Invitations were extended to marquises, counts from neighboring nations, Lucian's comrades-in-arms, Lillian's close friends, and esteemed families within Lunaris, including the Vales and Everharts. More than just a celebration, this event was a statement—a formal introduction of Baby Summer to the world, a moment that reflected both the family's prestige and the arrival of their next heir.

As the long-awaited day approached, the Vale family arrived ahead of the celebration, settling into the castle’s guest quarters. Cedric Vale, the family’s patriarch, was accompanied by his wife, Elara, and their daughters, Serina and Stephanie, though their son, Luke, was absent at the time.

Lillian hailed from the Vale family, descending from the same distinguished lineage as Cedric, making their ties with the Williams family deeply rooted in both blood and tradition. Celestia and Stephanie had been close friends since childhood, with Stephanie being a year older. Their bond was natural and effortless, rekindling instantly whenever they met. In contrast, Serina, reserved and shy by nature, often kept to herself and rarely joined in their lively interactions. As always, Celestia and Stephanie spent their time together, enjoying each other’s company just as they had countless times before. 

Both family’s presence at the event carried great significance, a reunion of two influential noble lineages. On the eve of the grand celebration, both families gathered for an intimate dinner, strengthening their bonds before the momentous occasion.

### Reception

On the day of the grand celebration, esteemed guests arrived one after another, their presence a testament to the Williams family's influence. Orion Everhart, the patriarch of the Everhart family, attended with his two sons, while representatives from the Norwood family, long-standing allies of Lucian, made their appearance as well. Nobles of high rank, including numerous marquises from neighboring realms and distinguished families from Lunaris, graced the occasion. Among them was Zane, the former Lord Commander of Avalon and one of Lucian’s most trusted confidants, who had been personally invited for a private discussion after the festivities.

The ceremony unfolded seamlessly, with the name "Summer" echoing throughout the grand halls, spoken with admiration and recognition. Laughter and conversation wove through the gathering as guests celebrated in an atmosphere of warmth and camaraderie. As the festivities came to a close, guests extended their heartfelt congratulations before taking their leave. The Vale family, due to pressing matters within their own domain, made an early departure, their absence felt but understood.

That evening, the Williams family shared an intimate dinner, hosting Zane as their honored guest. Conversations lingered over fine meals and aged wine, the air tinged with unspoken matters meant for another time. Once the gathering concluded, Lillian gently carried Summer to her chambers, with Celestia walking closely by her side, as the night settled over the castle.

Meanwhile, in the quiet of the study, Lucian and Zane sat in the glow of the flickering lanterns, the remnants of their evening meal settling into comfortable silence. Breaking the stillness, Zane, his curiosity evident, leaned forward and asked, "Lucian, what matter requires my attention?"

Lucian met his gaze with a measured nod. "I've been meaning to ask you for a favor, but let’s save that discussion for tomorrow during our outing. For now, get some rest—we have a long day ahead." His tone carried both seriousness and a hint of something unspoken, leaving Zane intrigued but willing to wait.

Respecting his friend's discretion, Zane let the matter rest. Alfred, ever attentive, stepped forward to escort him to his quarters, ensuring that every arrangement was made for his comfort.

### Future’s Outing

The next morning, as the sun cast long golden rays over Lucian’s domain, he and Zane set out, their presence commanding silent respect from those they passed. The crisp morning air carried the scent of dew-covered earth, and the rhythmic crunch of their boots against the stone pathways filled the quiet.

Though their strides were leisurely, there was an unmistakable weight to their movements—two men who had seen countless battles, who understood that even casual walks carried purpose. Zane, never one for excessive patience, glanced at Lucian and finally broke the silence. "So, what was it you wanted from me?"

Lucian’s lips curled into a knowing smirk as he came to a halt. "Before that," he said, rolling his shoulders in anticipation, "how about a spar?"

Zane sighed, disappointment flickering across his face, but nodded. His desire for answers was momentarily set aside, replaced by the thrill of combat. Word spread like wildfire through the castle—Lucian Williams, the formidable Patriarch, was about to spar with none other than Zane, the legendary former Lord Commander of Avalon.

Servants whispered in awe, guards abandoned their posts just to catch a glimpse, and even the seasoned warriors of the estate found themselves drawn to the impending clash. This was no ordinary duel—it was a battle between titans, a rare spectacle that only a handful would ever witness.

In the shadows of the grand halls, Alfred hesitated. Duty dictated that he should intervene—such power unleashed within the castle walls was dangerous. But deep down, he knew—this was beyond him.

The two warriors strode toward the Williams' training grounds, their footsteps deliberate, their presence commanding. Both were swordmasters of the highest order, but their true dominance came not from steel alone—it came from their mastery over Essence Manipulation, the force that shaped Avalon’s greatest warriors.

Lucian and Zane were not just experts. They stood amongst the pinnacle of warriors in Avalon.

Zane—one of the top twenty Essence Manipulators in all of Avalon, a warrior whose mere name instilled fear in the hearts of enemies. His battlefield instincts were unparalleled, his combat style a fusion of raw aggression and precision.

Lucian—a strategist without equal, a man whose mind was as sharp as his blade. While his essence manipulation lacked the brute force of some, his refined control made him nearly untouchable in battle. His mastery over defensive techniques and energy efficiency was legendary.

As they stepped into the ring, the crowd that had gathered held their breath.

They took their stances.

*"Begin,"* Lucian commanded.

The instant the word left his lips, the ground cracked beneath them.

Both warriors exploded forward at speeds that defied human comprehension. Zane was faster, his blade carving through the air with deadly precision. But Lucian—ever the tactician—was already anticipating it.

Steel met steel with an ear-splitting clash. Sparks danced through the air as Lucian executed his signature defensive technique, his parries flowing like water. Even as he deflected each strike, he began weaving aura around himself and his blade.

His power surged.

A heartbeat later, his speed doubled—then tripled—then surged tenfold. His movements became a blur, his attacks coming from impossible angles. Each strike carried the weight of a hurricane, the force of an avalanche. The air itself trembled under the raw energy radiating from him.

Zane gritted his teeth.

He had faced countless warriors, but this? This was monstrous. Each block sent tremors through his arms. It was all he could do to defend—Lucian’s relentless assault left him no opening, no room to counter.

Had Lucian chosen to coat his attacks with elemental energy, the battle would have ended in an instant. The same held true for Zane. Both warriors knew that unleashing their full power was unnecessary—this was a duel, not a war. Elemental infusion wasn’t just excessive; it would have left the battlefield in ruins, turning their spar into sheer devastation. So, they held back.

Just when it seemed like Zane would be overwhelmed—he stepped back.

Lucian’s eyes narrowed.

The battlefield stilled.

Then—Zane shifted.

Unlike Lucian, who spread his essence evenly, Zane did something far more dangerous. He funneled everything into his sword.

The air turned suffocatingly heavy.

The onlookers felt their knees weaken as pure, concentrated killing intent filled the training grounds.

Lucian immediately released his own aura. He had seen this before. If he maintained his energy, he wouldn’t evade in time.

And then—Zane vanished.

He didn’t just move fast—he ceased to exist for a fraction of a second.

Before Lucian could react, Zane reappeared within arm’s reach. Every ounce of his energy, once focused on his blade, had now shifted to his legs—granting him speed that defied logic.

Lucian barely had time to register the movement before—

Zane swung.

His blade, carrying the weight of his entire essence, descended like a judgment passed by the gods.

A deafening silence followed.

Then—

"I lose."

Lucian’s words cut through the air.

The crowd froze.

Zane's sword had stopped—mere millimeters from Lucian’s throat.

Had the strike landed, Lucian’s fate would have been sealed.

Zane exhaled slowly, allowing his essence to dissipate. A grin tugged at his lips. *"Still sharp as ever, Lucian."*

Lucian smirked, shaking his head. *"You always did fight recklessly. If that missed, you'd have been wide open."*

Their battle had ended.

But the message was clear.

Zane was still a monster.

Zane, still catching his breath, shot Lucian an exasperated look. "So are you finally going to tell me what this is this all about now?" he demanded, rolling his shoulders as he sheathed his blade.

Lucian, his grin laced with mischief, leaned forward slightly. "I want you to train my son in the coming years. I want you to be his mentor—his teacher."

Zane raised an eyebrow, clearly caught off guard. "Me? Why? Don’t tell me you’re doubting your own ability. You’re more than capable of training him yourself, Lucian."

Lucian let out a low chuckle. "Oh, I know I am. But you? You’re better. You always have been. That spar just proved it yet again. I don’t want my son to settle for ‘good enough.’ I want him to learn from the very best. So, Zane, I’m asking you—take my child as your pupil."

Zane exhaled sharply, crossing his arms as he considered the request. His expression was unreadable, his silence stretching just long enough for Lucian to notice. Then, with a sigh, Zane finally spoke. "Let’s not get ahead of ourselves. The boy hasn’t even grown a teeth much less manifested his Primordium yet. When he does, we’ll talk."

Lucian smirked, confidence radiating from him. "Fine. We’ll wait. But when the time comes, you’d better be ready—because my son is going to surprise you. He’ll be the greatest student you’ve ever had."

Zane shook his head, a small laugh escaping him. The tension between them eased, replaced by the warmth of old camaraderie. With that, they continued their outing, reminiscing about past battles, shared victories, and the uncertain future that lay ahead.

The next day, as Zane was preparing to depart from Lucian’s domain and return to the capital, he caught sight of Celestia in the training grounds, practicing her essence manipulation. She was focused, her small hands trembling slightly as she attempted to maintain the thin layer of energy coating her arms. Though unstable, the fact that she could manifest essence at such a young age was nothing short of astonishing.

Zane halted in his tracks, watching intently as she took a deep breath and tried again, this time holding the coating for a few seconds longer. A flicker of genuine surprise crossed his face before he turned to Lucian.

"You know, Lucian, why didn’t you ask me to train her too?" He gestured toward Celestia. "She’s got potential. Even a low-level essence coating at her age is unheard of. With the right training, she could become something truly exceptional."

Zane crossed his arms, considering for a moment before smirking. "You know what? Forget waiting for you to ask—I’ll train her too."

Lucian took a moment before responding, his gaze distant. "I know, Zane. I know better than anyone how much potential she has—how incredible she could become. But I'm also afraid." He exhaled, his expression softening. "I don’t want her to be forced down a path of hardship. I want her to grow at her own pace, to enjoy her childhood without the weight of expectations crushing her. She’ll find her own way in time, and when she’s ready... she’ll decide for herself. I know it might seem contradictory—I asked you to train Summer, yet I hesitate when it comes to Celestia. But Summer... he'll have responsibilities in the future, a duty he cannot avoid. And Celestia... even though she, too, will have her own burdens, I want to give her something different—a peaceful life, at least for now."

Zane exhaled in mild frustration but chose not to press the matter further. He knew Lucian well enough to understand that once his mind was set, there was little anyone could do to change it. With a final glance at Celestia—who remained focused on her practice, completely unaware of their conversation—he let out a small sigh.

"You're too soft when it comes to her," Zane muttered, more to himself than to Lucian.

Lucian simply chuckled, shaking his head. "Perhaps. But that's my choice to make."

Zane gave a small smirk before turning on his heel. As he made his way toward the gates, the weight of their conversation lingered between them. Lucian walked beside him in silence, neither feeling the need to say much more. When they reached the castle gates, Zane mounted his horse, gripping the reins as he cast one last look at his old friend.

"I'll hold you to your word, Lucian. When the time comes, don't let your fears hold her back."

Lucian met his gaze, his expression unreadable. "I won’t."

With that, Zane gave a small nod and spurred his horse forward, the sound of hooves fading as he disappeared down the road. Lucian remained at the gates, watching until his friend was out of sight before turning back toward the castle, his thoughts lingering on the uncertain future ahead.

# Dunford Outing

Two years had passed in a flash. Summer grew day by day, taking his first steps, forming sentences, and filling the Williams estate with his bright laughter. However, despite his steady development, there were still no signs of his Primordium awakening. Meanwhile, the family had also recently celebrated Celestia’s ninth birthday, marking yet another year of her rapid, almost unnatural, growth in Primordium.

Beyond the estate, Lunaris was experiencing turbulent times. The Black Veil Incident had shaken the entire country, leaving unease in its wake. Meetings between Cedric Vale and Lucian had been frequent in recent weeks, as discussions on how to handle the situation became urgent. It was decided that Lucian would soon travel to Dunford, the domain of the Vale family, to personally deliberate over the matter.

For this trip, Lucian had also invited Celestia to accompany him. Slowly but surely, he was beginning to introduce her to the intricate world of politics and diplomacy.

When news of Celestia’s visit to Dunford reached Stephanie, she was thrilled. It had been a while since they last saw each other, and she was eager to spend time together again.

As the day of departure arrived, Lucian and Celestia set off from Riverton to Dunford, traveling in a well-guarded carriage. The roads were busy, and the journey took several hours. Along the way, Lucian shared bits of knowledge with Celestia—about noble alliances, political maneuvering, and the importance of understanding people’s motives. While she listened intently, her mind often drifted elsewhere.

### Arrival in Dunford

As their carriage rolled past Dunford’s towering gates, Celestia peered out, taking in the sight of the city. Unlike Riverton, a hub of commerce, Dunford was a stronghold, built for war and strategy. Soldiers patrolled the streets, their disciplined presence a reflection of the Vale family's influence. Even the air felt different here—charged with the unspoken weight of battle-hardened history.

When they finally arrived at the Vale Mansion, they were greeted by Cedric and his family. Standing beside him, Stephanie practically bounced on her feet, her excitement barely contained.

The moment Celestia stepped down from the carriage, Stephanie rushed forward and hugged her.

"I've missed you so much!" she beamed. "We have so much to catch up on!"

Celestia chuckled at her enthusiasm. "You act like it’s been years!"

"It *feels* like it!" Stephanie huffed dramatically, then grabbed Celestia’s wrist. "Come on, let’s go! I’ll show you everything new in Dunford!"

That afternoon, the two wandered through the bustling market district, weaving between vendors calling out their wares. The streets were filled with the rich aroma of roasted meat, fresh bread, and exotic spices. Musicians played lively tunes in the background, and children dashed about, playing games between merchant stalls.

Yet, despite the lively atmosphere, Celestia seemed distant.

Noticing this, Stephanie nudged her. "What’s wrong, Celi? You don’t seem to be having fun."

Snapping out of her thoughts, Celestia hesitated before replying, her voice quieter than before. "It’s nothing… I’m happy we're doing this, really. But for the past month, I’ve been struggling with my training." She exhaled, her fingers clenching slightly.

Stephanie tilted her head. "Struggling? You? That’s a first," she teased, but when Celestia didn’t respond with her usual smirk, her playful expression shifted to concern.

Celestia frowned slightly, glancing down at her palm. "I can coat my body with my elemental aura, but it’s still too weak. And no matter how much I try, I can’t extend it to objects. I’ve trained every day, tested every method, and still... nothing. It should be simple by now, but I feel like I'm stuck, like something is missing."

She let out a frustrated sigh before shaking her head, forcing a small smile. "Never mind that. I’ll figure it out later. For now, let’s go eat pancakes."

Stephanie watched her for a moment, then broke into a grin. "Celi, you’re the strongest friend I have! Even my big brother Luke is weaker than you." She nudged Celestia playfully. "Don’t stress about it—you’ll get there. You always do! And when you do, you’ll probably master it so well that no one will be able to keep up. So stop worrying!"

Celestia blinked at her before chuckling softly. "You really think so?"

Stephanie rolled her eyes. "Of course! I wouldn’t lie to you. Now, let’s go! I’m starving!" She grabbed Celestia’s wrist and tugged her forward.

For a moment, Celestia let herself be pulled along, the warmth of her friend’s words pushing away the weight of her frustrations. Maybe she was overthinking it. Maybe, just maybe, she would figure it out—just like she always had.

And for now, pancakes sounded like a pretty good distraction.

Meanwhile, in the grand hall of Vale’s castle, Lucian and Cedric sat across from each other, their discussion stretching into its third hour. The atmosphere was tense, the gravity of their words evident in their expressions. Alfred stood nearby, his sharp gaze observing every detail, while Vale’s personal swordsman remained stationed at the entrance, a silent guardian to the high-stakes conversation.

The Black Veil Incident had shaken the entire nation. Reports of abandoned villages, livestock slaughtered, and entire populations vanishing without a trace had unsettled even the most hardened leaders. Cedric exhaled, his fingers tapping lightly against the armrest of his chair. “The more we investigate, the less we understand. My scouts returned with fragmented reports—whispers in the dark, shadows moving unnaturally. None of it makes sense. Some of them didn’t even made it back. A Black rose is the only link we have.”

Lucian’s eyes darkened. “If this continues, fear will consume the people before the enemy even reveals itself. We need answers, Cedric. And we need them soon.”

A heavy silence filled the room. Neither of them had an answer—only the certainty that whatever lurked in the darkness was far from ordinary.

Breaking the tense silence, Cedric leaned back with a knowing smirk. "So, what’s the deal with Celestia? Not only has she manifested one of the rarest elements, but her growth rate is downright monstrous. At this pace, your daughter might just surpass you before she even reaches her twenties."

Lucian exhaled slowly, his fingers tapping rhythmically against the armrest. His gaze drifted toward the grand windows, where the evening light filtered through. A flicker of emotion crossed his face—pride, concern, and something deeper. "That’s exactly what worries me," he muttered, his voice carrying an unspoken weight.

Cedric raised an eyebrow. "Worries you? That should be a damn blessing, Lucian. A prodigy like her—"

Lucian cut him off with a slight shake of his head. "Prodigies attract attention. The kind of attention I don't want on my daughter. You and I both know that talent alone isn’t always a gift—it’s a beacon, and not everyone who takes notice has good intentions." His voice was steady, but Cedric could hear the edge in it.

A brief silence settled between them before Lucian sighed, running a hand through his hair. "Talk about something else."

Cedric chuckled but didn’t push further, sensing Lucian wasn’t ready to dwell on the topic. Instead, he shifted gears, his tone turning more thoughtful. "I’m sending Stephanie and Serina to the capital soon. A close friend of mine will be mentoring them—a renowned Archmage Manifestor. It’s a year-long expedition, it’ll surely sharpen their abilities and give them exposure to the world beyond our domains." He paused for a moment before adding, "If you truly want Celestia to grow stronger, why not let her go too? She’ll gain experience, face new challenges, and refine her skills under someone I trust completely."

Lucian’s expression remained neutral, but his eyes narrowed slightly. "A Manifestor training an Essence Manipulator?" he though in his mind and was about to question that’s when Cedric caught on to the hesitation and leaned forward with a sly grin. "I know what you’re thinking—how could a Manifestor possibly help someone like Celestia?" His voice dipped slightly, laced with amusement. "Because she’s not just a Manifestor. She’s a dual-nexus user."

Lucian’s fingers stopped drumming against the armrest, his gaze sharpening. "A dual-nexus user? Are you talking about Elysia Wells?", Cedric gave a subtle nod, his expression unreadable. The weight of that revelation hung between them, and for the first time in their conversation, Cedric saw something new in Lucian’s eyes—interest.  After a moment of silence, he spoke, his voice measured. “Let me speak with Celestia and Lillian first. I need to hear their thoughts before making a decision.”

Dual Nexus User—someone capable of wielding two out of the three Primordium. They were rare, almost mythical, with only a handful known across the entire kingdom of Avalon. That one of them—an Archmage, no less—would be teaching his daughter was no small matter. Lucian felt a storm of emotions rise within him. Excitement, because this was an unparalleled opportunity. Worry, because the road ahead would not be easy. Happiness, because Celestia was growing stronger. And sadness... because he knew this was a path where she’ll pace a fair share of  difficulties, pain and struggle.

At dawn, Lucian and Celestia prepared to depart for Riverton. Celestia and Stephanie shared their goodbyes, their usual playful banter tinged with something softer—an unspoken understanding that things were about to change. Stephanie, following Cedric’s orders, refrained from mentioning her upcoming expedition. If Lucian refused the offer, Celestia’s stubbornness would undoubtedly create trouble.

As they rode away from Dunford, Celestia cast one last glance back at the towering walls of the Vale estate, her thoughts lingering on her friend. The road back to Riverton stretched before them, but for Celestia, it felt like something had shifted—like she was stepping toward something new, even if she didn’t yet know what.

## Departure of Celestia

The next day, Lucian sat with Lillian in their private chamber, the warm glow of the morning sun spilling through the arched windows. He had expected resistance, but instead, she listened in thoughtful silence as he explained Cedric’s offer. When he was done, she leaned back, arms crossed, her expression unreadable.

For a long moment, she said nothing. Then, with a soft sigh, she murmured, “She’s strong, Lucian. Maybe stronger than we realize.” Her fingers tapped lightly against the table. “I know you want to protect her. I do too. But we can’t shelter her forever.”

Lucian exhaled sharply, running a hand through his hair. “I just—” He hesitated, his usual composed demeanor cracking ever so slightly. “I don’t want her to face the same hardships we did.”

Lillian reached across the table, placing her hand over his. “I know,” she said gently. “But you’ve always told me Celestia has a fire in her heart. If we hold her back, we’ll only smother it. This is her chance to grow.”

Lucian frowned, but deep down, he knew she was right. After a long pause, he finally nodded. “Then it’s decided.”

Later that evening, Celestia was summoned to the grand hall, where both Lucian and Lillian sat in silence. Their unreadable expressions made her uneasy. The atmosphere was dense, pressing down on her like an invisible force. It felt like she was being judged—but for what, she wasn’t sure.

Finally, Lucian broke the silence, his voice calm but carrying a heavy weight.

"I'll get straight to the point, Cel." His golden eyes locked onto hers. "You already know how much potential you have. Your affinity may not have developed yet, but your aura control is leagues ahead of your peers." He exhaled, his fingers drumming against the armrest. "I’ve found a teacher for you—no, not me. Cedric Vale has arranged for an incredible mentor, not just for you, but for his daughters as well. She is a dual nexus user. They’ll be leaving for the capital next week. He asked if you’d like to go with them."

He leaned forward slightly, his gaze sharp and unwavering.

"I don’t want you to go."

Celestia's breath hitched, but Lucian wasn’t finished.

"I’ve always told you—I want to keep you happy. I want to give you everything so you never have to struggle. I don’t want you to bear the burdens this path will bring. Because make no mistake, Cel—this road is filled with hardship, with pain. And if I can shield you from that, I will." His voice wavered, just for a second, before he took a slow breath and steadied himself.

"But I also know you. Since you were a child, you've been relentless—drawn to power, to mastery, to understanding what lies beyond your limits. It’s in your nature to push forward, no matter the risk. And no matter how much I want to hold you back, I know that fire inside you won’t let you stay still."

He exhaled, rubbing his temples before meeting her gaze.

"So, I’ll ask this only once, Celestia. Do you want to go? This is an incredible opportunity, but I won’t lie to you—it won’t be easy."

"I’ll think about it and give you my answer tomorrow, Daddy." A small smile tugged at her lips, but there was a spark in her eyes—one that Lucian knew all too well. "I know you worry about me… but you worry too much. I don’t want to be a weak, boring sister to Summer—I want to be a cool one!"

Lucian let out a quiet chuckle, shaking his head, though the concern in his golden eyes didn’t fade. "You’re already cool, Cel," he muttered.

"Still," she added, stretching her arms dramatically, "I’ll take the night to decide. No rush, right?"

On the surface, she was composed, playful even. But inside, her heart was pounding. This was it—a step toward something greater. A chance to truly test herself beyond the safety of her home, beyond sparring matches and controlled training.

Celestia wasted no time. At the first light of dawn, she strode into Lucian’s study with unwavering resolve.

"I'm going," she declared, her voice firm.

Lucian barely reacted, his golden eyes scanning her face as if he had already known the answer. With a small sigh, he leaned back in his chair.

"I figured as much," he said, a hint of amusement in his tone. "I sent word to Cedric last night."

Celestia blinked, caught off guard for just a second before a smirk formed on her lips. "You really do know me too well, huh?"

Lucian chuckled. "Better than you think."

Stephanie was overjoyed when she received the news from the guard. Practically bouncing in place, she clapped her hands together, unable to contain her excitement. “Finally! She’s coming with us!” she exclaimed, a wide grin spreading across her face.

She had been hoping Celestia would join them, but with Lucian’s overprotectiveness, she wasn’t entirely sure it would happen. Now that it was confirmed, she couldn’t wait for their journey to begin.

Meanwhile, Cedric had already begun making the necessary arrangements. He would personally accompany the children to the capital, as he had official business to attend to as well. “Might as well make use of the trip,” he muttered, reviewing his itinerary. However, deep down, he knew this journey would be more than just a diplomatic visit. 

### Goodbye, Before the Storm

The week passed in a blur, and before she knew it, the day of departure arrived.

The estate buzzed with quiet urgency as preparations neared completion. Packing was in full swing, with servants moving swiftly through the halls, ensuring everything Celestia might need was accounted for. 

Celestia herself was all over the house, darting from room to room, making last-minute requests and double-checking her belongings. She wasn't nervous—if anything, excitement bubbled beneath the surface—but the weight of leaving home for a whole year pressed against her, even if she refused to acknowledge it.

Alfred, the ever-loyal butler, wore a rare look of sorrow. He had served the Williams family for years, watched young Celestia grow, and now, for the first time, she would be away for an entire year. "Do take care, young mistress," he said solemnly, adjusting his gloves as he watched her from a distance.

Lillian, ever the careful mother, had made a crucial decision—Celestia would not go alone. She had appointed a personal maid for her journey, a woman named Lily. Though Lily presented herself as nothing more than a dutiful servant, she was far more than that. A formidable Primordium user, she had been assigned not just to serve but to protect and, if necessary, report back to the Williams family. Celestia had been oblivious to this arrangement at first, but when she noticed the way her mother’s gaze lingered on Lily, she understood.

And finally, the moment arrived. The estate’s grand doors stood open, the carriage prepared, and the time for goodbyes drew near.

Lucian stood at the entrance, his usual composed demeanor faltering just enough to reveal the sorrow hidden in his eyes. In his arms, Summer clung to him, his tiny hands gripping tightly as he gazed around in confusion. He was too young to fully grasp what was happening, but he could sense the shift in the air—the weight of farewells unspoken.

And that’s when a carriage arrived. A grand obsidian carriage with silver engravings awaited—majestic black horses with silver-tipped manes and faintly glowing eyes—stood harnessed to it, their breaths misting in the morning air. This was no ordinary horse cart. It was a symbol of nobility, of departure, of destiny.

Not long after, Stephanie and Serina arrived.

The moment the carriage came to a halt, Stephanie practically burst out, her excitement overflowing.

"Celestiaaa! You’re finally coming!" she squealed, her grin stretching from ear to ear as she rushed forward. Her enthusiasm was infectious, radiating an energy that made it impossible not to smile.

Serina, on the other hand, stepped out with her usual composed demeanor. Her expression remained unreadable, her gaze sweeping over the scene with mild indifference. Unlike her sister, she didn’t share the same outward excitement—at least, not visibly.

Cedric also approached to greet the Williams family, exchanging a brief but knowing glance with Lucian. No words were needed—just a silent understanding between two fathers.

Meanwhile, Alfred and Lily busied themselves loading the luggage into the carriage, their movements efficient yet careful. The atmosphere shifted as the final preparations came to an end.

Celestia, mid-conversation with Stephanie, suddenly felt the weight of the moment settle over her. This was it—the moment of departure. Turning away from her friend, she faced her father, who stood quietly behind her.

Lucian stared at her for a long moment, his golden eyes filled with emotions he rarely voiced. Then, without a word, he pulled her into his arms. He was not a man of open affection, but today—today was different.

Lucian’s embrace tightened ever so slightly before he finally spoke, his voice softer than usual.

"Stay safe, Cel." Lucian’s voice was steady, but the way his hands lingered on her shoulders betrayed the weight of his emotions. He searched her face as if trying to memorize every detail. "No matter where you are, if you need me—just send word. I’ll be there."

His grip tightened for just a moment before he exhaled, his golden eyes dimming with a sorrow he wouldn’t speak aloud. “It’s going to be too quiet without you.”

Celestia felt a lump rise in her throat. She had promised herself she wouldn’t cry, but hearing that… She clenched her fists at her sides, forcing the tears back.

“I’ll be fine, Daddy,” she whispered, her voice barely holding steady.

Lucian managed a small, bittersweet smile. “I know you will. That’s what makes this so damn hard.”

Lillian, who had remained silent until now, stepped forward, her gentle fingers brushing a stray lock of Celestia’s hair behind her ear.

"Take care of yourself, my love." Her voice was warm yet firm. "Be strong, but don’t forget to be kind. Power means nothing if you lose sight of who you are."

Celestia met her mother’s gaze and nodded, swallowing the emotions rising within her.

This was it. The beginning of something new.

Then, there was me—Summer. Clinging to her sleeve, giggling, too young to understand what was truly happening.

Celestia crouched down, pressing a soft kiss to my forehead, her fingers gently brushing through my hair.

"I’ll be back before you know it, baby Summer," she whispered.

She lied.

She didn’t mean to. She truly believed it.

None of us knew the truth.

This was the last time Celestia and I would ever see each other.

Destiny had other plans.

She stood, turning toward the waiting carriage. With one last look at our family—at the home she had always known—she stepped inside.

As the wheels began to turn, carrying her away from us, away from everything familiar, Celestia turned back. Her gaze met mine as I waved, smiling, oblivious.

I didn’t know.

I didn’t know that sometimes, destiny is cruel.

Slowly, the carriage disappeared into the horizon. And just like that… she was gone.
