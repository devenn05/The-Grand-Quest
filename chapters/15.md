Chapter 15: The Unmet Reunion

Distant voices echoed in the void.

*“Summer! Summer, wake up! Wake up, bro!”*

My mind felt heavy, like I was sinking into an endless ocean. My body refused to move, my senses dulled—until suddenly, warmth. Soft sheets beneath me. The faint scent of medicinal herbs. The low murmur of voices, distant yet familiar.

I wasn’t in the cave anymore.

Blinking through the haze, my vision slowly adjusted. The dim glow of lanterns lit the room, casting long shadows against the walls. I was back in the castle—back in my bed, completely wrapped in bandages. The quiet hum of medical equipment filled the air, a sign that the best healers had been tending to me.

Around me stood was Mom, Dad, Alfred, Orion, Reus, Chris, and several Williams family guards. Their faces were a storm of emotions—relief, sorrow, guilt.

Lillian’s eyes glistened with unshed tears, her hands trembling as she gazed at me, as if afraid I might disappear. Chris looked down, weighed by silent remorse. Alfred, normally composed, seemed at a loss for words. Only Lucian and Orion maintained their composure, but even then, the fury in Lucian’s eyes was barely contained.

Lucian was the first to speak, his voice firm but carrying an edge of worry.

*"Are you alright, Summer?"*

It wasn’t the right question but he knows that the real wound wasn’t just physical. Whatever had happened, whatever had put me in this state, would haunt me far beyond the pain of my injuries.

He asked again, softer this time.

*"Are you alright, son? You don’t have to tell us what happened… just tell me if you’re okay."*

I forced a faint smile. My body was weak, but my voice remained steady.

*"Yes, Dad, I’m fine. I know my injuries might say otherwise, but… I’m good now."*

Lucian let out a deep breath, the tension in his shoulders easing, as if he had been holding it in since the moment I went missing. He placed a firm hand on my shoulder, his grip strong and reassuring.

*"Rest now. When you're ready, we’ll talk about what happened. And don’t worry about your injuries—I’ll take you to the capital, to the best healer. I know Physical wounds are painful one, but we can heal. For now, just focus on resting, son."*

With that, he turned to the others.

*"Give him some space."*

One by one, they left the room—except for My Mom.

Silence settled between us. She sat beside me, unmoving. She wasn’t speaking. Just… *staying*. I could feel the weight of her unspoken emotions pressing down on the room.

I frowned.

*"Mom… what’s wrong? "*

Lillian’s expression shifted in an instant. Her lips trembled, and the tears she had been holding back *spilled over.*

*"Did you even look at yourself? And you ask what’s wrong?!"*

Her voice cracked, her anguish pouring out like a dam breaking.

*"You are in the worst condition imaginable. While you were suffering, I was here, living a normal life in the castle—completely unaware! And you ask what’s wrong?! How can you say that?!"*

I closed my eyes for a moment, taking in her words, feeling the raw emotion behind them. Then, gently, I spoke.

*"Mom… stop."*

She froze, startled by the calmness in my voice.

*"You did nothing wrong. This wasn’t your fault. It was something none of us could have predicted nor prevented. What’s done is done, and there’s no changing it now. Please, don’t blame yourself."*

Her hands clenched into fists, her shoulders shaking.

*"I’m happy, Mom. I got to live. I got to see you, Dad, and everyone else. That’s enough for me."*

I wanted to say more. I wanted to tell her that I had thought about Celestia—that in those moments when death felt certain, all I had wanted was one last moment with my family.

But I hesitated.

The words caught in my throat, stuck somewhere between grief and exhaustion.

Instead, I pushed the thought aside.

With effort, I sat up slightly. Lillian panicked, immediately reaching to stop me, but before she could, I pulled her into a hug.

*"See? I’m fine. I can still hug you. I can still talk to you. And soon, I’ll walk again too. Everything will be alright."*

Lillian stiffened for a moment. And then, she *broke.*

She clung to me, sobbing into my shoulder, all the fear, guilt, and love spilling out at once.

And for the first time since waking up—since everything that had happened—

I felt *at peace.*
