A new day. A new beginning. 

We began our journey before sunrise, same as yesterday.

Yesterday had been rough—grueling, even—but good. The kind of grinding that leaves you sore in all the right places. If we keep this up for twenty straight days, I might see some real growth in my essence pool—and maybe, finally, signs of a core.

That said, I don’t think we’ll even need twenty days to reach Silverlake. We covered almost forty kilometers yesterday. If we keep that pace, we’ll be there in twelve… maybe thirteen days tops.

“Hey Ronan,” I call out while running, “we’ll reach Silverlake in under twelve days at this rate. Why’d you say we’d need twenty?”

Ronan gives me a sideways glance, then rubs his chin. “We could make it in five if we wanted. But that’s not the point. The goal isn’t just to reach Silverlake—it’s to grow while we move. We’ll be slowing down the distance covered day by day and focusing more on hand-to-hand combat, Essence control, and other training forms. I’ve got a few methods in mind. For today though, we stick to yesterday’s rhythm.”

Made sense. Grind and pace, not sprint and collapse.

Aurora speaks up. “Ronan… about Resonance—Julian warned me never to practice it. Said it was too risky. I didn’t ask you about it yesterday because I wanted to try it out, since you brought it up… but was it really okay?”

I nod. “Same here. It felt like a shortcut—like some kind of cheat code for Essence compression. But I’ve never heard of it before. Not even Zane mentioned it.”

Ronan’s expression hardens. “Julian was right. Resonance is dangerous. Rapidly burning and replenishing Essence does force your body to accelerate core formation, but it comes at a cost. If you rely solely on it, the core might form unstable—too weak, too fragile. That’s how people lose their core entirely. And you both know what that means.”

Now it makes sense why neither Zane nor Alfred ever mentioned it. Of course they wouldn’t—they wouldn’t risk teaching me something that could strip me of everything. I could lose my primordium.

But... I’m still far from core formation. My Essence is just loose mist swirling in my body. It might be okay in the early phase.

Ronan continues, “You’re probably wondering why I let you two try it, then. Two reasons. Aurora—this isn’t really for you. I let you try because I sensed your core is close to stabilizing. You’re on the edge of breaking into full-stage Ember. Two, maybe three sessions more, and you’ll be there. After that, drop Resonance completely.”

Aurora nods silently, processing his words.

“As for you, Summer,” he turns to me, “you don’t even have a core yet. You’re still gathering Essence. This method gives you a kickstart—something to force the Essence to start clumping together. My goal is for you to hit full-stage Kindle within the next few days. Once you do, we stop Resonance immediately.”

I stare at the ground, jaw clenched. Aurora’s about to reach Full Ember. That’s the same stage as my mother. And she’s doing it in the first week out here.

What the fuck, man. Races really do set us back.

“Okay, Ronan,” Aurora says, nodding confidently.

“Roger that, Master Ronan,” I chime in with mock salute.

He rolls his eyes and tosses a rock at me. I dodge it.

A few hours later, we take our first break—my Essence is completely tapped.

I drop into a seated position on the grass. Meditation time.

And like that, the days start to blur.

Resonance burns me hollow. My Essence pool breaks, reforms, expands—until it finally starts to behave like it wants to become something real. Something solid. A core.

Morning runs. Essence drills. Combat lessons. Meditation. Eat. Sleep. Repeat.

Aurora hits Full stage Ember on the third day. She stopped practicing Resonance, Ronan increased the sparing sessions between them.

By the fifth, I begin to feel the Essence condensing—not just floating, but pulling in bit by bit.

Ronan keeps the pace brutal but manageable. Skye follows us from branch to branch, occasionally hopping down to nap on our packs when we stop. At night, the meals taste like heaven after a day of Essence starvation.

And just like that, a week flies by.

---

It’s still early morning, the air cool and heavy with dew. Aurora’s curled up under her blanket, snoring softly. Ronan had shaken me awake just a few minutes ago, and I’m still groggy as hell. Skye, true to form, is snoozing on my chest like a warm, breathing pillow. She doesn’t budge when I sit up.

Nearly two hundred and fifty kilometers this week—on foot. That’s more than I thought humanly possible. We even passed the spot where I started my journey where I found the logs and that bonfire—the very beginning of all this. I barely recognized it.

Strange thing is, I’ve started to like this routine. The rhythm of waking up, training, pushing my body, falling asleep exhausted only to do it all over again. Each day brought a new challenge. Something real. Something worth facing. I still want to go back home eventually… but the truth? I feel more at peace out here in the wild than I ever did in Riverton, sitting still. Guess I was never built for quiet. Still, I’m barely fourteen—nearly there, but not quite. What kind of kid thinks like that?

I shake the thoughts off, pack up, clean the camp. Aurora stirs awake, yawning like a cat, her silver-blonde hair catching the faint blue light. Ronan spoked, “Today, we’re not traveling,” he announces, hands on hips. “In fact, we won’t be traveling every day anymore. From now on, it’s alternate days only.”

I blink. “So… what’s the plan for today?”

Ronan’s eyes gleam. That look always means trouble.

“You’re both going to fight me. The whole day. Non-stop.”

I stare at him. “WHAT?!”

Aurora sits up straighter, alarmed. “Ronan, how is that even possible?”

“Come on, it's not that difficult.” He grins. Bastard's enjoying this. “You’ll take breaks—short, strategic ones. You’ll manage your Essence burn, track your stamina, stay coordinated. Work together, adapt. Every dodge, every strike, every essence burst has to be deliberate. No waste. You’ll need to switch roles mid-fight, alternate who's defending, who's applying pressure. Learn to read each other without words. Pick up on breathing patterns. Timing. Gaps. You need to think like a unit—not two people fighting, but one force.”

He starts pacing. “You'll train your reaction speed, refine your movements to the bare essentials. No flashy crap. No wasted motion. You’ll have to learn restraint as much as aggression. And most importantly—keep going. Even when you’re dead tired. Even when every muscle screams to stop. That’s endurance.”

“But still,” Aurora says, rubbing her eyes, “a whole day? Isn’t that… a bit extreme?”

“Not at all,” Ronan replies calmly. “Last week was about building your Essence and starting core development. This week? It’s endurance. And Essence control under duress. You won’t grow strong just by meditating or running. Real strength comes when your body’s breaking, and your spirit refuses to. You’ll fight until it becomes second nature—until strategies and stamina sit in your bones.”

I glance at Aurora. Her mouth’s tight, eyes unreadable, but she nods.

Yeah. We’re in this now.

Ronan doesn’t wait. The second he finishes the words “Form a damn strategy,” his foot drags the dirt—then he’s gone. A blur. No warning. No time.

I barely roll aside in time as his hardened fist crashes into the spot I stood. The ground shakes. A puff of dust kicks up and cuts my view.

So that’s how we’re starting…

I feel Aurora’s essence spike, sharp and reactive. A spike erupts from the earth in front of Ronan like a jagged fang, but he weaves sideways, slipping around it like wind curling around stone. No hesitation. No pause.

“Summer, left!” Aurora yells.

I see him—he’s already pivoting, heading my way. Stone Fist. My hand hardens just in time as I raise it to block a hammering elbow. Pain lances through my arm anyway.

Fuck… it’s like hitting a mountain.

Ronan grins at me, teeth sharp like he’s tasting blood. “Don’t defend. Flow.”

He pushes off me and launches toward Aurora. She responds instantly—her feet slam into the dirt and three narrow glass blades whip from her shoulders and fire at him. He bats one down, sidesteps another, and lets the third slash past his shoulder without flinching.

I rush in from behind, trying to catch him between us. My sword flashes, low and quick, aiming for the backs of his legs.

He hops just enough.

“Better,” he says, twisting mid-air to deliver a kick toward my ribs. I pull essence around me and brace.

My shield catches it—barely.

I stagger back, breath rushing out of me. Not good enough. Not even close.

The next hour is hell.

Ronan doesn’t slow. If anything, he’s building pressure, testing us. He switches his focus between us at random—never predictable, never merciful. Aurora keeps her ground mostly—manifesting stone spikes and glass armor as she dances around him—but even she’s starting to pant. Her movements are sharp but slower now.

My Stone Fist flickers on and off, a countdown I’m painfully aware of. I try to use it only when I can land a hit, but Ronan never lets me.

By noon, sweat's rolling down my back like rain. My essence pool feels half-drained, my body even worse.

We regroup during a short break—barely two minutes of silence under the shade of a crooked pine.

Aurora sits beside me, breathing hard. Her glass armor flickers and dissolves as her concentration breaks. Skye, of course, sleeps in a patch of sunlight like we’re not dying here.

“You good?” I ask.

“No,” she says between breaths. “But I’m better than you.”

I grin. “Fair.”

She reaches out, brushes dirt from her cheek, and mutters, “He’s not even using essence the way we are. It’s all just movement and timing. Like he’s reading everything.”

“He is,” I say. “He’s built different.”

Then we hear it: clap clap clap.

Ronan stands thirty paces out in the clearing, arms crossed. “Break time’s over.”

Aurora sighs. “Kill me.”

“Already tried. Didn’t work,” I mutter.

We rise and charge together.

This time we try coordination. Aurora pins him in from the front—spikes bursting upward in erratic patterns, forcing him into tight steps—and I stay behind, weaving in and out of range with quick blade strikes. I time my Stone Fist perfectly once, landing a direct punch to his ribs. He grunts, finally, but grabs my arm and flings me like a ragdoll across the clearing.

I crash into the dirt. Again.

The sun climbs high, and still we fight. My shield flickers weaker each hour. My instincts help me move, dodge, recover—but I’m slower now, barely blocking in time.

Aurora, has taken bruises to the face, side, and legs. Her manifestations come slower now, her glass cracks easier.

And still Ronan doesn’t let up.

He tests our formations, forces us into bad positions, punishes hesitation.

By sunset, we’re broken. Both of us.

Aurora leans on me, glass shattering off her body in thin sheets. Her breath hitches like she’s been holding it for hours.

My arms feel like stone. Not Stone Fist. Just… stone. Dead weight. No strength left. My essence burns in shallow flickers. One more use of my hardening might knock me out cold.

Ronan steps back finally, his chest rising only slightly with each breath. No bruises. No injuries.

“Not bad,” he says, almost too casually. “Tomorrow we travel. Next day we go again. One week of this.”

I drop to the ground like a stone and stare at the sky. “He's a fucking demon.”

And just like that, the pattern sets in.

One week we travelled—grueling terrain, steady pace, long hours. On the move, we built endurance, cycled Essence, refined footwork, ate sparingly. The next day, we fought. From sunrise to sunset. No breaks. No mercy.

And somewhere in the middle of all that—things began to change.

I felt it creeping in, subtle at first. My Essence moved faster through my limbs. It didn’t just push—it flowed. My instincts sharpened. My control steadied. I lasted longer in every spar. Reacted quicker. The shield held better, flickered less.

Aurora too—her spikes landed cleaner, more deliberate. Her glass armor shifted with her now, not against her.

Even so, Ronan still wiped the floor with us.

But we lasted longer.

By the end of that week, we crested a small rise at dawn. The wind had shifted, and the scent of brine hung heavier in the air.

It was already dark, I heard the current of water more clearly than any night before—fearsome, strong, like it had something to say.

Ronan cracked a grin. “We’ve almost made it. One week more, I guess. Let’s set up camp here for the night.”

One more week, huh?
