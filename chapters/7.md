Chapter 7: The Pattern

*“I’ve been walking for, what, two hours now? Feels like forever. When the hell is this cave gonna end? My legs are screaming, my essence is draining, and my life force—well, let’s just say it’s not looking great.*

*But hey, I should be grateful, right? I’m still breathing. Barely.*

*My right arm’s gone, but it’s not the end of the world. I can fix it... probably.*

*Not that it matters if I don’t make it out of here.*

*Because let’s be real—he’s coming for me. And when he finds me?*

*I’m dead.”*

### **Peaceful Day in Riverton**

So yeah, you already know—I’m Summer Williams. I’ve given you the whole rundown on my family and all that, so let’s not drag it out. In two months, I’ll be turning eleven. My Life here? Peaceful. Maybe even a little too peaceful.

My days follow the same routine: wake up, train, sit through private lectures, eat lunch, train some more, finally get some free time, then dinner, then sleep. Rinse and repeat. Honestly? Not a bad deal. For someone like me—who’d rather not be running around doing crazy warrior stuff 24/7—it’s pretty perfect. At least, compared to what my dad originally had planned for me.

Not that those expectations were ever really *mine* to begin with. No, those were all because of Cel.

She showed them something so insane, so beyond anything a normal person could do, that it didn’t matter what I did—I was always going to be stuck in her shadow. They expected that maybe, *maybe*, I’d be able to follow in her footsteps, that I’d be some kind of prodigy like her. Scratch that—they *knew* I would be.

Well, joke’s on them. The destiny had other plans.

And honestly? It’s a little unfair to expect more. I mean, they literally created a *monster*. No, even *monster* doesn’t cover it. Cel was something else entirely. And me? I was just… me.

Like I told you before, mighty Zane was supposed to be my tutor, and yeah—he started training me as soon as I manifested Essence. He was a damn good teacher, but there was only so much he could do. Most users don’t even *start* growing with their Essence until they hit their teens. Sure, some potential buds start showing early signs of power, and of course, everyone thought I’d be one of them.

It was just another normal day—same as always. Dad wasn’t in Riverton; he had a meeting with Orion Everhart. You remember him, right? The guy who showed up at my naming ceremony with his two sons? Brian and Ryan—yeah, I know. Twin brothers, masters of Essence manipulation, five years older than me.

Dad was meeting with him to talk about developments on *Case Black Veil*.

That nightmare that’s been haunting Lunaris for the past ten years—since *my* birthday.

Yeah. I don’t know if I was born to bring some great contribution to the world, but one thing’s for sure—I definitely dragged an omen in with me.

The very *first* Black Veil incident happened on my first birthday. You remember the Vale family leaving early? That was because of *this*.

So what exactly happened that day?

An entire village—*gone*. Not a single person left. The houses? Untouched. Their belongings? Still there. But the people? Vanished.

The first incident happened in the Vale domain. Then, it started happening in Riverton.  Then in Lucial. The disappearances weren’t as massive as the first one, but still—whoever was behind this wasn’t just strong. They were *smart*.

I wouldn’t even be surprised if they were a *Reality Influencer*.

Yeah, so like I said—it was just another normal day.

Me, Reus, and Chris were lounging on the castle walls, doing our usual evening strolls.

Who are Chris and Reus?

Chris Valer, son of Sheela, one of our maids. Loud, reckless, and practically a walking explosion of energy. The guy never sits still.

Reus Saden —son of the Saden family, one of Riverton’s combatant forces. Quiet, composed, sharp as a blade. The kind of guy who could probably dodge an attack before you even thought about swinging.
Total opposites. Yet somehow, we three just *clicked*.

 So we were strolling around castle as this was the only free time I got, and honestly? I’d rather nap here until dinner than waste energy running around.

Chris, of course, had other plans.

"*Hey Reus, let’s go play in the garden!*".

I groaned. "*Please don’t.*"

If I had known what was going to happen, I would've gone directly to my chambers in the castle.
