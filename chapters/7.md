A narrow exit—not even sure I’d call it that. More like a hole straight down. I couldn’t see the bottom. I tossed a rock in, just to check… waited. Ten… fifteen… twenty seconds later, a distant clack. Yeah. That’s where I came from? Seriously? This cave. This goddamn cave.

How the hell am I even out? I couldn’t have climbed up that in one piece—hell, not even if I was in one piece, let alone half-dead. And what the actual fuck happened just before I blacked out? Who was that?

Did he bring me back? Restored my arm and leg like that? Just fixed me up like I’m a goddamn toy?

Where even am I? Am I alive?

I think I’m alive.

I feel alive.

But… how?

I am so fucking confused.

Whoever that guy was, he definitely knows something about what the hell just happened to me. The problem is—I never saw his face. All I’ve got is a voice burned into my memory. And that one damn line.

“He’s not the one to take.”

Take for what?

Really, fuck this. First things first—I need to get the hell out of here.

I looked around, and it was obvious. This isn’t Riverton. Not even close. The Forest, this trees here? Nothing like the ones back home. Weather here is too warm compared to Riverton.

Some were tall—insanely tall. No branches, just straight up like massive bamboo stalks trying to stab the sky. Others were weird and stubby, scattered like someone planted them drunk, with fat bulbous trunks and swollen big black fruit hanging low, pulsing faintly like they were breathing.

A few had twisted, spiraling bark that looked like corkscrews. One tree had vines dangling off it like hair—bright red and swaying slightly, even though there was no wind. And then there was this one creepy thing—thick as hell, but hollow-looking, with holes in the trunk that made this low whistling sound whenever I got too close.

Yeah. Not Riverton. Not even the same fucking league.

Are they edible? I have no idea. But I’m starving…..

NO!

No point risking it when I don’t have to. My Essence’s enough to keep me hydrated for a week—and full of energy for at least three, maybe four days without any food.

No more near-death experiences, thank you very much.

Even the birds are off. Like weird shapes and colors I’ve never seen before. Not in Riverton, not in Lunaris.

 Am I even still in my own goddamn country?

I gulp hard, trying not to panic. No use freaking out. I start moving.

As for that vampire? Not a chance I’m giving him a burial. Let him rot right here in the dirt. Actually—on second thought—if anyone does find this spot and connects it to me, great. So I leave a quick mark—just in case. This way they’ll know which direction I went, and hopefully come that way.

First thing I’m hunting for? A stream. Water usually means people. And maybe a road. And maybe someone who can explain where the hell I am.

Also, I need a weapon. Anything. A stick. A rock. A sharpened fruit if it comes to that. I’m not stepping anywhere without something I can swing around like a maniac if things go sideways again.

No more “unarmed Summer”.

As I continued walking, pushing past the thick, alien trees, something caught my eye through a break in the dense canopy.

A little ways ahead—rising like a jagged scar on the horizon—I spot it.

A mountain.

I start walking toward the mountain. Navigating from the top will be easy, Summer. Let’s climb it up. Saying that to myself like some pep talk would, I started climbing.

Just before the incline, I grab a wooden stick. If things go south, at least I’ll have something—a tool, a weapon, or just a piece of wood to die holding.

The climb’s steep as hell, but manageable. My body’s sore and I’m starving, but my Essence pool? Honestly, it’s full as fuck. I feel like I could take on two or three vampires right now.

Father… Mother… they must be going out of their minds. I wish I could tell them I’m safe. That I’m okay. I don’t want them reliving the same nightmare again.

Fuck. I really don’t.

About an hour into the climb, I finally get above the tree line. From here, I can see everything—endless stretches of dense forest on one side, and another mountain in the far distance. The sun’s on its last breath, golden light spilling across the canopy like molten fire.

Man, what a view.

Would’ve been perfect with some grilled meat and a nice jug of beer. Not that I know what beer tastes like. Okay fine—a jug of cold Cola. That I do know.

Snapping out of it, I pick up the pace. If the sun’s completely down, I won’t see shit. No moon either. Not even a sliver. It’s either new moon or a day around it.

But that realization hits harder than it should.

When that fucker abducted me, I clearly remember—it’d been a week since the last full moon. And now, with the new moon already here… has a whole damn week passed?

Was I trapped in that cave for days? Or did I just pass out and sleep through the whole thing? Or maybe that mysterious guy took me somewhere, kept me out this long?

Fuck, I don’t know.

Man, I can’t even begin to imagine what my parents must be thinking. A week of grief.

I shove the thought down and keep climbing.

Eventually, I reach the peak. The sun’s gone now. Everything below is pitch black. No village lights, no smoke trails—nothing. I’ll have to spend the night up here and figure things out tomorrow.

To my surprise, those weird fruit trees from earlier grow up here too. I sit beneath one, legs aching, and after hesitating for what feels like an hour, I reach for the fruit.

Surely a bit wouldn’t kill me….

One bite in—

What the actual fuck!

It tastes like a damn apple. Just… bigger. With a kick of sourness.

Saying to myself like an insane person, “Please don’t be poisonous, please don’t kill me now,” I munched on three to four of those weird fat apples.

I was starving. I needed this. But now I’m worried. Why the hell am I getting this lucky all of a sudden? This much luck only comes with a side of “something horrible’s coming.” I’m not being negative here, I’m just realistic. Life hasn’t exactly been all strawberries and sunshine.

Still—none of that matters right now.

Because holy shit—

I killed a vampire.

Even Zane couldn’t manage that. He told how difficult it was to just face-off with one and sang the glory of his great grandfather who defeated one in his time in Bahaman.

And what the hell is with this new Primordium. I’m a dual Primordium user.

DUAL. PRIMORDIUM.

Snap.

And then I saw something different.

What the hell is this?

Something I definitely missed back in that cavern—and thank god I didn’t see it there, not with him.

Two seconds passed.

Yup. I do have a second Primordium. But it’s not controlling time—it’s space.

It’s like a dimension around me, a space locked in place. The air close to my skin? Completely still. Couldn’t even feel it. But I could still hear the world outside—the distant hum of life carrying on. So yeah, I’m not pausing the whole world, just the space around me.

What I thought before—that I could freeze everything? Yeah, bullshit. If that cavern had been even a bit bigger, or if Draven had been out of reach, he would've seen right through me. He would’ve known. Would’ve never fallen for that.

I got lucky. That’s the truth. Real fucking lucky.

Although it’s not how I expected my newborn Primordium to work… I’m still grateful. Grateful it woke up when I needed it most. Grateful that I got out alive. Arms and legs still attached. That’s a miracle in itself. And whatever this second Primordium is… whatever this awakening means—it’s crazy. I haven’t ever heard of anyone awakening a second Primordium.

But this is real. This is mine now.

All the comparisons… the constant weight of expectations. Years of being average. That I wouldn’t amount to anything.

Screw that. I finally have something to fight back with. Maybe it's childish, but I want this win for myself—for once.

And yeah, it eats up a buttload of Essence. I haven’t figured out exactly how long I can keep it up, but safe bet? Three times in a row, max. When I pushed it to four earlier… well, I know what happened. Yeah, I used Essence on a bunch of other crap too, but still—I’ll assume that three’s the limit for now.

Enough of this.

I pushed the thoughts aside and stared at the sky. Darkness everywhere, kinda like that void I was pulled into, but stars peeked through the drifting clouds. Small lights in the nothing. I closed my eyes, the gently cool mountain night settling around me.

I slept. No idea what tomorrow has in store for me.

---

A sucker punch—straight to the jaw. No bullshit, clean KO. That’s how the universe decided to greet me this morning.

What I mean is, yesterday, when I climbed this damn mountain, I saw about three to four kilometers of forest, and then a rocky slope going up. That was it. Forest, mountain, sky.

What I *didn’t* see was the vast, endless ocean waiting just beyond that ridge.

Which means... I’m nowhere near Lunaris. Hell, not even Riverton. And considering Lunaris is basically dead-center in Avalon, that’s a terrifying realization.

But the real kicker?

The other side of the mountain.

Just trees. Dense, dark forest stretching far beyond the horizon. No peaks. No rivers. No streams. No signs of life. Just green suffocation in every direction.

And if I ever wanted to crawl back to Riverton—back to anything familiar—my only way out would be straight through that choking wilderness. The same forest that's marked as “unexplored territory” in every map I've ever seen. Great.

I sat down. Took a long, shaky breath. Tried not to panic. But let’s be real—I was deep in shit.

I remembered from geography class that Avalon’s coastal regions are mostly untouched—untamed—because of how damn impenetrable the forest gets the closer you are to the edges of the continent. And now I was staring directly at it. Firsthand.

So I had a choice.

Brave the forest, with no idea where I’d end up—or if I’d even make it out alive.

Or follow the coastline. It’s not easy, sure. Ports are rare, scattered. But it’s *something*. A direction. A destination. Even if it takes weeks, maybe months, there’s a chance I’ll find someone. Something. Civilization.

But of course, there’s a problem.

Aquarians.

Aquarians—races of the water, born and raised near oceans, rivers, even ponds. Blessed by water, they become exceptionally powerful if born as Manifestors, as their affinity with the water element amplifies their strength. They’re not monsters—none of us are, really. Elves, Vampires, Beastkin, Aquari... we all look more or less the same. Two arms, two legs, one head. No wings. No tails. No grotesque limbs sticking out. Just... subtle differences. The kind you have to really look for to notice. With Aquari, it’s their skin—thin and light scale-like patterns shimmer across it, catching light like ripples on water. Barely visible unless you’re forcing yourself to see what sets them apart.

But Aquari… they’re not exactly the friendly type. Especially toward humans. And not just us—pretty much every other race rubs them the wrong way.

So if I run into them, yeah—there’s a high chance it might go south fast. But what choice do I have? I’ll cross that bridge when I get to the start of it, I guess.

Also—I’m starving.

“Bring me my apples, Alfred!”

“Yes, Master Summer. Here are your apples. Freshly plucked from the wild, unknowable forests of Avalon.”

Yeah. I’ve definitely lost it. Talking to myself. Roleplaying. I’m a one-man play at this point. But hey, something has to keep me entertained. And if nothing else, I’m damn self-sufficient.

Munching on those apples, I begin descending the mountain. The path’s a little rocky, but manageable. If I don’t fall and crack my skull, I should be at the base in twenty-five minutes, give or take.

From there, the plan’s simple: Walk across the forest to the mountain hugging the coast. Two to three hours of walking, then a steep climb that might take another hour or two. All in all, I’d reach the top—or even the coastal edge—by evening. That is, assuming the universe didn’t slap me in the face again.

So, I descended. Walked through the forest. And weirdly… it was too easy. No roots trying to trip me, no thorns clawing at my clothes. The ground was weirdly flat. Yeah, the trees were thick and crooked—made it hard to walk in a straight line—but I could keep my direction. Just me, the trees, and the silence.

And that’s when it hit me.

This forest... why aren’t there any animals?

And right as the thought formed, right as I began to ask that cursed question…

…the universe, ever so kind, gave me my answer.

A Freaking Mossback appeared in front of me.
