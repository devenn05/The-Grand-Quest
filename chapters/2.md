Chapter 2: The Abduction - Part I

### **13 Years Later**

**A few days ago,**

Over the years, life was… well, pretty average. Training with Zane? Yeah, that happened—but let’s just say, Even the best car won’t matter if the guy behind the wheel’s a dud. Still, I trained. I studied. I learned under all kinds of tutors and mentors—combat, theory, history, you name it. And through it all, I grew alongside my two closest friends: Chris and Reus.

Chris Valer—our maid’s son—and Reus Saden, heir to the Saden family, one of Riverton’s elite combat houses. On paper, we couldn’t be more different. In reality? We just *fit.* Since we were seven, we’ve trained together, fought together, laughed, bled, and nearly died together. They’re more than friends—they’re family.

A lot’s happened in those years, honestly. Enough to fill an entire volume… but none of it matters right now. Because what I really want to tell you—the *real* story—starts with what came next.

It was just another normal day—same as always. Dad wasn’t in Riverton; he had a meeting with Orion Everhart. You remember him, right? The guy who showed up at my naming ceremony with his two sons? Brian and Ryan—yeah, I know. Twin brothers, masters of Essence manipulation, five years older than me.

Dad was meeting with him to discuss about developments on ***Black Veil*.**

Yeah, the case is still open—plenty of leads, endless theories, but not a shred of concrete evidence. No one truly knows who—or what—is behind it. The disappearances after the first weren’t as massive, but they were just as deliberate. Whoever’s pulling the strings isn’t just powerful… they’re calculated. However one thing was for sure, A Reality Influencer was involved—one of the three types of Primordium. The rarest. The most dangerous.

Yeah, so like I said—it was just another normal day.

Me, Reus, and Chris were lounging on the castle walls, doing our usual evening strolls.

We had planned to play in the garden that day—what felt like the best decision of my life… and also the worst. Who would've thought destiny had something like *that* in store for me? Anyway, we went to the garden to play volleyball.

The garden was tucked away in a quiet corner of the castle grounds, far from the noise of the main halls. It was big, open, and peaceful—like a slice of calm carved out just for us. Neatly trimmed hedges formed winding paths, and tall trees cast long, gentle shadows across the grass. Roses, lilies, and strange glowing flowers native to Lunaris bloomed along the edges, their scent mixing with the fresh cut of green. A small stone fountain bubbled in the center, the water soft and steady. It was the kind of place where time seemed to slow down—a hidden spot for laughter, games, or just quiet peace. Guards were stationed not too far, their presence subtle but watchful. 

Still… something felt off that day. Like the garden was holding its breath.

I felt it. That eerie weight of unseen eyes pressing down. But then Chris was already pulling me into the game, so I brushed it off. Maybe I was imagining things.

We played. Chris, as hyper as ever, was practically bouncing off the walls, and even Reus—usually the serious one—was getting competative. And me? I was there. Forced into it. No escape. Just when I was about to convince myself to enjoy it, the ball bounced toward me—

And that’s when the chill hit me.

It shot down my spine, freezing me mid-movement. My instincts screamed at me to turn. So I did—just the slightest glance over my shoulder.

And for a split second, I *saw* it. A shadow. Lurking. Watching.

And then—gone.

Vanished, like it had never been there. My gut twisted. First that feeling of being watched, and now this? 

But who would be stupid enough to sneak into the Williams estate? No one with a functioning brain, that’s for sure. If they had a death wish, then… well, that was their problem.

So, I ignored it. Batted an eye again. And just when I as about to move on, the air shifted.

This time, it wasn’t a feeling.

It was real.

One of the guards—gone.

No sound. 

No struggle. 

Just… *gone*.

A sickening silence settled over the garden. The other two guards stiffened, their gazes sharp as they scanned the area, muscles tense, ready for a fight.

Reus and I noticed immediately.

A sinking weight formed in my stomach. The feeling from earlier? It hadn’t been my imagination. Something *was* here. And now, something *was* happening.

I met Reus’s eyes. We didn’t need words. Without hesitation, we split up, scanning different sections of the garden.

Looking back, maybe we should’ve just run.

Because the moment we started searching, we had already lost.

We combed through the area for nearly five minutes, the garden unnervingly silent. One of the guard approached Chris and motioned for him to head back into the castle with us. As he started walking toward me to signal my turn, it hit.

A presence.

*Dark*. *Overwhelming.*

It crashed into my mind like a tidal wave, sinking its claws deep into my consciousness.

I *froze*.

This was different. This wasn’t just a bad feeling. It was something far, *far* worse.

My body locked up. I couldn’t move.

And then—

I *saw* it.

A hand.

Pale. Grotesque. Emerging from the empty space right in front of me.

Just a hand.

And yet, the sheer *wrongness* of it sent terror surging through my entire being.

I tried to move. I *wanted* to move.

But before I could—

It *grabbed* my throat.

Cold. Like death itself.

I gasped, instinctively trying to coat my body in essence—*nothing*. My essence wouldn’t respond. My body refused to listen.

The grip tightened.

It was *pulling* me in.

Dragging me toward that warped space—toward the unknown.

Chris had reached me just in time to see it.

His mouth opened—he wanted to scream. He wanted to move.

But terror held him in place.

And just like that—

I was gone.

## **Whispering Cave**

The air was damp, thick with the scent of wet stone and decay. The air was damp, thick with the scent of wet stone and decay. The kind that clung to your nose and settled into your clothes. Faint echoes of dripping water bounced off the jagged cave walls, forming a slow, eerie rhythm in the silence. Pale green moss crawled over the rocks, and small patches of glowing fungi blinked like stars in the dark. The ground was uneven and slick, every step a careful decision. It wasn’t freezing, but the chill in the air had weight—like the cave itself didn’t want us there. It felt ancient… like something had been asleep for a long time.

My consciousness stirred. My head throbbed, limbs feeling heavy. Slowly, my eyes fluttered open, and the blurred outlines of my surroundings sharpened into focus.

I wasn’t alone.

A man sat before me—broad-shouldered, well-built, dressed in simple yet refined attire. His presence exuded strength, but something about him felt... off. As my senses adjusted, I realized.

That scent.

A thick, unmistakable aura clung to the air, sending a primal chill down my spine. I lifted my gaze. Dark, amused eyes met mine. And then, that man smiled.

Sharp. Elongated.

Fangs.

A vampire.

My heartbeat pounded crazily, mind racing. Vampires were a rarity—ghosts in history, myths whispered among terrified villagers. Few ever saw one in their lifetime, and even fewer lived to speak of it. 

If a vampire was an Essence Manipulator, their energy levels dwarfed those of ordinary humans.

 If they were Manifestors, they became even deadlier.

And if they possessed Reality Influence...

There was no research. No records. No survivors.

Panic clawed at my throat, but before it could consume me, recognition struck me like a lightning bolt.

This wasn’t just any vampire.

This man...

"*You—*" My voice caught in my throat.

He smirked. “*Ah, so you do remember me……name’s **Draven.*** Pleased to meet you Summer Williams”

He was from Cedric Vale’s domain, a trusted knight within their ranks. I saw him many times when Cedric came to our domain. He was always with him and now that same guard now sat before me.

“*You... you were one of Cedric Vale’s men. A guard of Dunford.*”

Draven let out a chuckle, stretching lazily. *“I was many things.*” His eyes gleamed with amusement. “*Funny, isn’t it? All those years I spent within your walls, and no one ever suspected a thing. A fake history, a fabricated background... and suddenly, I was a knight.*” He leaned forward, grinning. “*Your father, Cedric, Orion all ran in circles for years, desperately searching for the culprit behind the disappearances. If only they had looked a little closer.*”

I was so confused. “*So it was you. You’re behind the Black Veil Incident.*”

Draven tilted his head slightly, his grin smug and sharp. *“Black Veil... how dramatic.”*

He met my glare and didn’t flinch—just bared those unnerving fangs again.

*“Yes. I was the one who erased that village. Want to know why?”* He leaned in, eyes glittering with malice. *“Some nobody—one of those backwater bumpkins—looked me in the eye and spoke to me like I was his equal. A vampire. Mocked me like I was some common human.”*

He chuckled darkly, the sound echoing in the damp air. *“Of course, I killed him on the spot. But that wasn’t enough. No... he needed to suffer more. So I made sure his entire village vanished with him. Left behind a little mystery I knew they'd never solve. A gift, if you will.”*

Draven straightened, his tone turning colder. *“After years of Slumber, I wake up to that? Mockery? From a human?”*

He scoffed. *“Yes, I did it. And the best part? I was right there the whole time—under their noses. And they never suspected me.”*

His expression twisted into something darker. *“Humans... such fools.”*

I was trapped. Alone. Facing something I had no chance of fighting. Only a handful of people in Lunaris could stand against such a monster, and obviously, I was not one of them. Not even close.

While I was thinking, something shifted.

A flash of movement.

An arc of energy sliced through the air.

Pain.

Agonizing, searing pain.

My mind barely registering what had happened, my vision blurred as my body convulsed.

Then—I saw it.

My arm.

Gone.

The next thing I saw was Draven holding my severed arm close to his mouth. His fangs gleamed in the dim light as he sank them into the flesh.

The sickening sound of tearing. The sensation of bones cracking. Draven sighed in pleasure, licking the blood from his lips.

“*You taste even better than I expected,*” he murmured, his voice dripping with satisfaction.

My screams were raw, filled with agony. My body trembled uncontrollably, my mind barely able to grasp the sheer horror unfolding.

Draven chuckled. “*Oh, don’t pass out on me now.*” His grin widened, his crimson eyes glowing with excitement.

“*I’m going to enjoy eating you.*” Saying that, Draven left the cave, leaving me in that pitiful state.
