Chapter 2: Reception

You know how summer feels, right? Warm. Wild. Full of life. My parents must’ve thought the same thing when they named me. Maybe they believed I’d bring the same kind of energy into their lives. Maybe they just liked the way it sounded. Either way, **Baby Summer had arrived.**

April 1st—the day the news spread like wildfire. Not just in our household, but all across Lunaris. My dad, Lucian Williams, the kind of man who **doesn’t do things halfway,** personally picked my name. **Summer.** A name meant to stand for strength, warmth, and a future so bright it could outshine the sun.

And, of course, with a name like that, my arrival couldn’t be some quiet little affair. No. **It had to be legendary.**

A grand naming ceremony was planned, the kind that made a statement. Not just a party, but a declaration—**"Here he is. The next heir of the Williams family. Remember the name."** Invitations were sent out to marquises, counts from neighboring nations, Dad’s war comrades, Mom’s closest friends, and, naturally, the Vales and Everharts—our fellow ruling families of Lunaris. This wasn’t just about welcoming me into the world. **It was about power. Prestige. Making sure everyone knew exactly where we stood.**

## Vale & Williams Get Together

The Vale family arrived first, days ahead of the main event. Cedric Vale, their patriarch, brought his wife, Elara, and their daughters, **Serina and Stephanie.** Their son, Luke, was absent, probably off doing something important—though knowing Luke, that could’ve meant anything from a high-stakes mission to a mid-afternoon nap.

Now, here’s the thing—Mom was originally a Vale. **Same bloodline. Same legacy.** So our families weren’t just allies, we were bound by tradition, by history. 

Celestia and Stephanie had also been attached at the hip since childhood. **Best friends. Partners in crime. Unstoppable when together.**

Serina, though? **Total opposite.** Quiet. Reserved. The kind of person who preferred the sidelines over the spotlight. She never really joined in, just observed, blending into the background while her sister and Celestia ran wild.

The night before the big celebration, both families gathered for a private dinner—**one last moment of calm before the storm of nobility, politics, and endless formalities.** Strengthening ties, sharing laughter, exchanging stories. It was all about keeping up appearances, about unity. About showing the world that the Williams and Vale legacies stood together.

### **Reception**

The day of the grand celebration finally arrived, and with it came a flood of guests—**each one a walking symbol of power and prestige.** One by one, they arrived, their mere presence a reminder of just how far the Williams family’s influence reached.

Orion Everhart, head of the Everhart family, made his entrance with his two sons in tow, their every step **oozing nobility.** Representatives from the Norwood family, long-time allies of my father, arrived soon after. Then came the marquises Leonhart and Zesha. Many of the high-ranking nobles, and the distinguished families of Lunaris and many more—all here to witness the official introduction of **Baby Summer.**

But the one guest who stood out from the rest? **Zane.** Former Lord Commander of Avalon. A legend in his own right. **And more importantly—one of my father’s most trusted friends.** He hadn’t just come for the party. No, Dad had personally invited him for a private discussion once all the pleasantries were over.

The ceremony itself went off without a hitch. My name echoed through the grand halls, repeated by nobles, warriors, scholars—each one speaking it with admiration, recognition. Laughter filled the air, drinks flowed endlessly, and conversation sparked in every corner of the estate.

By the time the festivities wrapped up, the guests began their slow departure. One after another, they bid their farewells, their voices laced with congratulations and well wishes. The Vale family had to leave earlier than expected—**urgent matters back home,** something about “Black veil”. Their absence was noticeable, but no one questioned it. **Politics worked in its own quiet, complicated ways.**

Later that evening, **after the castle had settled into a quieter hum,** my family shared an intimate dinner, with Zane as our honored guest. The conversation stretched late into the night, lingering over fine meals and aged wine. There was laughter, yes, but also an underlying tension—**the kind that hinted at words left unsaid.**

Once the gathering came to an end, Mom carried me to her chambers, Celestia trailing closely behind. The night outside was calm, but inside the castle? **Something was brewing.**

In the dim glow of his study, my father sat across from Zane, the flickering lanterns casting long shadows on the walls. The remnants of their evening meal rested on the table between them, neither of them paying it much attention.

Zane leaned forward, curiosity sharp in his eyes. **“*Lucian, what matter requires my attention?*”**

Dad met his gaze, unreadable as always. **“*I've been meaning to ask you for a favor. But let’s save that for tomorrow, during our outing. For now, get some rest. We have a long day ahead.*”**

There was something unspoken in his tone—**serious, deliberate.** A conversation for another time, another place.

Zane, despite his curiosity, didn’t push. He simply nodded, understanding the weight behind my father’s words.

Alfred, ever the perfect butler, stepped forward right on cue. **“*Allow me to escort you to your quarters, Lord Zane.*”**

And just like that, the conversation ended. **For now.**

Morning light spilled over the Williams estate, casting long golden rays as Lucian and Zane stepped onto the stone pathways. Their movements were unhurried, but there was a weight to them—**the kind only carried by men who had fought and bled on too many battlefields.**

Zane, never one for patience, finally glanced over. **"***So, what is it you wanted from me?***"**

Lucian smirked. **"***Before that, how about a spar?***"**
