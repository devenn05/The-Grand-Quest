# Reaper Fang Origin Arc

Avalon—a continent of towering mountains, rushing rivers, and endless green. Half its land meets the wild, untamed ocean, while the other half stretches with vast forests, fertile plains, and ancient landscapes. Its 17 nations thrive within this balance of land and sea, shaped by the power and mystery that define Avalon itself.

Lunaris, the Nation of Peace, is ruled by three great noble families—Williams, Everhart, and Vale—each governing a distinct region of the country. These families stand at the pinnacle of the upper noble hierarchy, shaping Lunaris through their unique legacies.

The Vale family is feared and respected for its formidable combat forces, producing elite warriors and military strategists.

The Everhart family specializes exclusively in medicine, pioneering advancements in healing techniques, alchemy, and disease treatment.

The Williams family is known as masters of Essence Manipulation, refining their control over life energy to unlock abilities far beyond normal human limits. Though intellectuals at heart, their expertise lies in harnessing, refining, and evolving Primordium essence, making them unparalleled in their field.

The current head of the Williams family, Lucian Williams, resides in the grand family castle alongside his wife, Lillian Williams. They have one daughter, and another child is soon to be born.

Serving them are a head butler, three maids, and three servants—all of whom possess Primordium blood, as only those with awakened affinities are deemed worthy of holding positions within Lunaris’ noble houses.

Lucian Williams was a master strategist and essence manipulator, a name recognized across all of Avalon. With numerous accolades to his name, he played a pivotal role in the Lanka War, where he served as a warlord, leading his unit to decisive victories.

It was Lucian who elevated the Williams family to greatness. Once mere Counts, the family now stood among the Marquesses, a rise attributed solely to his brilliance, influence, and unwavering ambition.

His wife, Lillian Williams, born into the formidable Vale family, was an exceptional Primordium user, a rare Manifestor whose abilities defied expectations. Together, they forged a dynasty that reshaped Lunaris’ power balance.

Their daughter, Celestia Williams, was seven years old and had begun to show signs of Essence Manipulation.

Today is March 26th, and the Williams family eagerly awaits the arrival of their baby in the coming week. Preparations are in full swing, with Head Butler Alfred ensuring that all necessities for the newborn are meticulously arranged.

The castle's security had been significantly tightened, and Lucian himself remained within its walls, ensuring his family's safety. However, strange occurrences had begun unsettling his domain. A Walking Calamity—a being of misfortune a Reality Influencer —was rumored to be within the territory, leaving the entire domain in a state of tension. Under Lucian’s direct orders, an active search was underway.

At dawn, an unexpected guest arrived at the castle, claiming to be a friend of Lillian. Alfred, the head butler, unable to recognize her, asked her to wait in the castle’s waiting room before informing Lillian. Upon hearing the news, Lillian instructed Alfred to bring her in, while Celestia remained in the room.

As Alfred escorted the guest inside, Lillian found herself unable to recognize the woman. Just as she was about to ask her identity, Celestia let out a sudden, piercing scream. Shocked, Lillian and Alfred froze, unsure of what had happened. Being a nascent Essence Manipulator, Celestia immediately sensed the ominous aura surrounding the woman. However, both Lillian and Alfred were Manifesters, unable to perceive what their daughter had just witnessed.

The moment Celestia screamed, the woman—who had introduced herself as Sasha—suddenly lunged toward Lillian, her intent dripping with vicious killing intent. Acting purely on instinct, Celestia threw herself between them, pushing Sasha back before she could reach her mother. But in that split second, Sasha’s hand brushed against Celestia.

Everything happened in an instant. Alfred, stationed at the entrance, immediately rushed forward, attempting to separate Sasha from the family. But it was too late—Sasha had already touched Celestia. Realizing the imminent danger, Alfred’s blade was drawn in a flash, its edge coated in flames. Without hesitation, he struck, severing Sasha’s head in one clean motion.

Lillian stood paralyzed, her mind struggling to process the rapid succession of events. Nearby, Celestia's initial shock had escalated into an adrenaline surge, causing her to faint. Alfred, maintaining his composure, swiftly summoned the guards. Within moments, a contingent of 10 to 12 guards stormed into the room, their weapons drawn. Lucian, alarmed by the commotion, rushed in to find Lillian in a state of shock, Celestia unconscious, and the lifeless body of the intruder sprawled on the floor. Suppressing his rising anger, Lucian demanded an explanation from Alfred, who recounted the harrowing incident in detail. Maids promptly arrived to attend to Celestia and console Lillian. It became evident that the deceased woman was indeed the rumored Walking Calamity. Lucian felt a mix of relief and fury over the threat that had infiltrated his home. Amidst the turmoil, no one noticed the brief contact between Sasha and Celestia. Four days later, the incident faded into the background as the family celebrated the birth of their newest member.

Just as the summer season brings warmth, growth, and abundant energy, the birth of Baby Summer filled the Williams family with immense joy and happiness. His arrival symbolized a time of vitality and flourishing, much like the season he was named after.

On April 1st, the birth of Baby Summer was announced, spreading joy not only within the Williams domain but across the entire land of Lunaris. Lucian personally chose the name Summer for his son, symbolizing warmth and vitality. To celebrate this auspicious occasion, the Williams family planned a grand naming ceremony and reception on April 12th. Invitations were extended to esteemed guests, including marquises and counts from neighboring countries, Lucian's comrades-in-arms, Lillian's friends, and prominent families within Lunaris, such as the Vales and Eveharts. This event aimed to formally introduce Baby Summer to the realm, reflecting the family's esteemed status and the joyous arrival of their heir.

In the aftermath of the unsettling incident, young Celestia was haunted by restless nights, her sleep disrupted by lingering fears. This distress persisted for nearly a week before she gradually returned to her usual self.

As the much-anticipated day approached, the Vale family arrived ahead of the celebration, taking residence in the guest quarters of the castle. The patriarch, Cedric Vale, was accompanied by his wife, Elara, their daughters, Serina and Stephanie, and their son, Luke. Given that Lillian was Cedric's niece, the families shared a close bond. They gathered for a familial dinner on the eve of the main event, strengthening their ties.

On the day of the celebration, esteemed guests arrived in succession. The head of the Evehart family attended with his two sons. Representatives from the Norwood family, close allies of Lucian, were present, though Lord Norwood himself was absent due to pressing matters. Numerous marquises from neighboring realms and prominent families from within Lunaris graced the occasion. Notably, Zane, the former Lord Commander of Avalon and a trusted friend of Lucian, was in attendance, having been personally invited for a private discussion post-event.

The ceremony proceeded flawlessly, with the name "Summer" resonating among the attendees. The atmosphere was filled with joy and camaraderie as guests mingled and celebrated. As the festivities drew to a close, guests extended their heartfelt congratulations to the Williams family before taking their leave. The Vale family departed earlier than planned due to unforeseen obligations in their own domain. Zane remained at the castle, as he and Lucian had scheduled a private engagement in the coming days.

Following the day's events, the Williams family gathered for an intimate dinner, extending their hospitality to Zane. After the meal, Lillian gently carried Summer to her chambers, where Celestia awaited with eager anticipation, her eyes alight with affection for her newborn brother. She delighted in his presence, her youthful exuberance bringing a tender warmth to the room.

Meanwhile, in the study, Lucian and Alfred engaged in conversation with Zane. Curiosity evident, Zane inquired, "Lucian, what matter requires my attention?" Lucian, with a thoughtful nod, replied, "We'll discuss it further during our outing tomorrow." Respecting his friend's discretion, Zane tempered his curiosity. Alfred then escorted Zane to his quarters, ensuring his comfort for the night.

The next day, Lucian and Zane set out for an outing within Lucian’s domain, both carrying themselves with a commanding presence. As they walked, Zane asked, "So, what was it you wanted from me?"

Lucian smirked and replied, "Before that, how about a spar?"

Zane sighed, disappointment flashing across his face, but nodded. Word quickly spread through the castle—Lucian, the Williams patriarch, was about to spar with Zane, the legendary former commander. Alfred, caught between concern and duty, hesitated, wondering if he should intervene.

The two made their way to the Williams' training grounds. Both were renowned swordmasters, but their true prowess lay in essence manipulation. Zane was among the top 50 manipulators in all of Avalon.

They took their stances.

"Begin," Lucian commanded.

The moment the word left his lips, both launched forward at blinding speed. Zane was a fraction faster, his blade sweeping toward Lucian. But Lucian countered effortlessly, using his signature defensive technique. As he parried, he began coating his body and sword in aura—raw energy that amplified human limits.

The instant his coating was complete, his speed surged tenfold. His attacks became relentless, each strike carrying crushing power. Zane found himself on the defensive, struggling to keep up as Lucian’s rapid strikes rained down. Had Lucian infused his attacks with elemental energy, the duel would have already been over.

Just when it seemed Zane was about to lose, he suddenly stepped back.

Lucian tensed.

Zane began channeling his essence—not around his body, like Lucian, but solely into his sword. The air around him grew heavy. Recognizing the shift, Lucian immediately dispelled his own aura, preparing to evade.

But in an instant, Zane redirected all his energy into his legs.

He vanished.

Before Lucian could react, Zane closed the distance at an inhuman speed, transferring his energy back into his sword just as he swung.

And then—

"I lose."

Lucian’s voice broke the silence.

As their spar came to an end, Zane, still catching his breath, shot Lucian an annoyed look. "Are you finally going to tell me what you want?" he demanded.

Lucian, wearing a mischievous grin, replied, "I want you to train my son in the coming years. I want you to be his mentor—his teacher."

Zane raised an eyebrow, clearly surprised. "Why me? Don’t you want to train him yourself? You’re more than capable, Lucian."

Lucian chuckled. "I know I am. But you? You’re even better. I want my son to learn from the very best. That spar just proved how much stronger you still are. So, Zane, I ask you—take my child as your pupil."

Zane leaned back, arms crossed, his expression unreadable. After a brief pause, he sighed. "Let’s see how your boy turns out first. He hasn’t even manifested his Primordium yet. We’ll talk when he does."

Lucian smirked. "Fine, we’ll wait. But you’d better be ready—because my son is going to shock you. He’ll be the best student you’ve ever had."

Zane shook his head with a small laugh, and the tension eased. With that, they continued their outing, strolling through the domain and talking about old battles, shared memories, and the uncertain future ahead.

The next day, Zane was prepared to depart from Lucian’s domain and return to the capital. As he made his way out, he caught sight of Celestia playing in the park. Turning to Lucian, who was escorting him, he asked, "Why not ask me to train her too? She has potential. Even a low-level essence coating at her age is insanely impressive. You know what? Why don’t I return in three years—not just to see what Summer has manifested, but to take our little Celestia on a six-month expedition?"

Lucian gave a slight nod but responded firmly, "We’ll see about that. I don’t want Celestia involved in battle. I want to keep her as far away from all this as possible. I know how much potential she has, but her well-being comes first."

Zane exhaled in mild frustration but didn’t push further. With a final glance at Celestia, he turned and departed the castle, Lucian walking him to the gates before watching him ride away.
A year had passed since Zane and Lucian's last meeting, and Celestia’s growth had been nothing short of astonishing. Despite Lucian’s reluctance to train her, he had hired an essence manipulation master to teach her the fundamentals. She had revealed herself to be a rare Elementalist—wielding the power of darkness. The last time Zane visited, she could barely form a basic aura around herself. Now, she had advanced to a refined level, her control far beyond what anyone had expected. Even Lucian was surprised by her rapid progress.

In a week's time, Cedric Vale was set to visit Lucian to discuss Lunaris' development and ongoing issues. He was bringing his daughter, Stephanie, who was a year older than Celestia at nine. Over time, Stephanie had become a close friend to Celestia, always being the one to initiate conversations whenever their families met. Unlike her shy elder sister, Serina, Stephanie was outgoing and playful, making it easy for the two to bond. As always, they had planned to spend time together during this visit.

That day, the two of them wandered through the bustling market district of Lucian’s domain, browsing through various stalls and enjoying the lively atmosphere. However, Celestia seemed distracted.

Noticing this, Stephanie nudged her and asked, "What’s wrong, Celi? You don’t seem to be having fun."

Snapping out of her thoughts, Celestia hesitated before replying, "It’s nothing… I’m happy we're doing this, but for the past month, I’ve been struggling with my energy transformation technique. I can coat my body with my elemental aura, but it’s still too weak, and I can’t extend it to objects. I’ve been trying for so long with no progress… It’s just been on my mind." She sighed before shaking her head. "Never mind that, I’ll figure it out later. For now, let’s go eat pancakes."

Stephanie grinned. "Celi, you’re the strongest friend I have! Even my big brother Luke is weaker than you. Don’t stress about it—you’ll get there. I know you will do it! Now, let’s go! I’m starving!"

Lucian and Cedric sat in the grand hall of the castle, their discussion stretching into its third hour. The air was thick with seriousness, Alfred standing by with a watchful gaze, while Vale’s personal swordsman remained stationed nearby. It was clear that something significant was being discussed—something tied to the black veil incident.

Breaking the tense silence, Cedric leaned back with a smirk. “So, what’s the deal with Celestia? Not only has she manifested one of the rarest elements, but her growth rate is downright monstrous. At this rate, your daughter is going to surpass you before she even hits her teenage years.”

Lucian exhaled, his fingers drumming lightly against the armrest of his chair. “That’s exactly what worries me,” he muttered, his tone carrying an unspoken weight. “Talk about something else.”

Cedric chuckled but didn’t press further. Instead, he shifted the conversation. “I’m sending Stephanie and Serina to the capital soon. A close friend of mine will be mentoring them—a renowned Archmage Manifestor. It’s a year-long mentorship, designed to sharpen their abilities and expose them to the world beyond our domains. If you truly want Celestia to grow stronger, why not let her go too? She’ll gain experience, face new challenges, and refine her skills under someone I completely trust.”

Lucian narrowed his eyes slightly, sensing there was more to this. Cedric, catching his suspicion, leaned in with a sly grin. “I know what you’re thinking—she’s a Manifestor, so how could she possibly train an Essence Manipulator?” His voice dropped just slightly, carrying a hint of amusement. “Because she’s a dual-nexus user.”

Lucian’s expression shifted, the revelation catching him off guard. He leaned back, processing the implications. After a moment of silence, he spoke, his voice measured. “Let me speak with Celestia and Lillian first. I need to hear their thoughts before making a decision.”

The Departure of Celestia

Celestia was summoned to the hall, where Lucian and Lillian sat in silence, their expressions unreadable. The atmosphere was heavy, pressing against her like an unseen force. She felt as though she were being judged, though she didn’t know why.

Finally, Lucian broke the silence. His voice was calm but carried an unmistakable weight.

"I'll get straight to the point, Cel. You already know how much potential you have. Your affinity may not have developed yet, but your aura control is far ahead of your age group." He paused, exhaling. "I’ve found a teacher for you—no, not me. Cedric Vale has found an excellent mentor, not just for you but for his daughters as well. They’ll be leaving for the capital next week, and he asked if you’d like to go with them."

He leaned forward slightly, his golden eyes sharp.

"I don’t want you to go."

Celestia's breath caught, but Lucian wasn’t finished.

"I’ve always told you, I want to keep you happy. I want to give you everything so that you never have to struggle. I don’t want you facing the challenges this path will bring. Because make no mistake, Cel—this road is full of pain. And I don’t want you to suffer, not in any form." His voice wavered, ever so slightly, before he steadied himself. "But I also know you. You’ve always been fascinated by this. Since you were a child, you’ve been obsessed with manipulation, with control, with strength."

He sighed, rubbing his temples before looking at her again.

"So, I’ll ask only once. Do you want to go? It’ll be an incredible opportunity, but I won’t pretend it’s easy."

Celestia met his gaze, her expression unreadable.

"I’ll think about it and give you my answer tomorrow, Daddy." A small smile played on her lips. "I know you worry about me… but you worry too much. I don’t want to be a weak, boring sister to Summer—I want to be a cool one!"

Lucian chuckled under his breath, though the concern in his eyes remained.

"Still," Celestia added, "I’ll take the night to decide."

On the surface, she was calm. Inside, she was soaring.

This was it. A step toward something greater.

Lillian, surprisingly, did not oppose.

The Next Morning

Celestia wasted no time. At dawn, she walked into the study where Lucian sat.

"I'm going."

Lucian barely reacted, as if he had known all along.

"I figured as much," he said, leaning back. "I sent word to Cedric last night."

Sephaine was **overjoyed** when she heard the news, practically bouncing with excitement.

The week passed in a blur, and before she knew it, **the day of departure arrived.**

Lucian stood at the entrance, his usual composed demeanor betraying the sorrow in his eyes. **Summer, too young to understand, clung to Celestia’s dress.**

Lillian meticulously packed her belongings while **Lily, her personal maid, stood nearby, ready to accompany her.**

Outside, **a grand obsidian carriage with silver engravings** awaited. **Four duskfang steeds**—majestic black horses with silver-tipped manes and faintly glowing eyes—stood harnessed to it, their breaths misting in the morning air. This was no ordinary horse cart. It was **a symbol of nobility, of departure, of destiny.**

Not long after, **Sephaine and Serina arrived.**

Sephaine practically leaped out of the carriage, her excitement **impossible to contain.**

"Celestiaaa! You’re finally coming!" she beamed, her energy infectious.

Serina, however, merely stepped out with a blank expression, uninterested in the excitement.

Celestia turned back to her father.

Lucian stared at her for a long moment before pulling her into his arms. He rarely showed such open affection, but today was different.

**"Be safe, Cel,"** he murmured. **"No matter what happens, if you ever need anything—anything—just send word."**

Celestia felt a lump in her throat but refused to cry. Instead, she held onto him tighter.

"I'll be fine, Daddy."

Lillian, who had remained silent all this time, finally spoke, brushing a strand of Celestia’s hair behind her ear.

**"Take care of yourself. Be strong, but don’t forget to be kind."**

Celestia nodded, swallowing the emotions threatening to surface.

Then, **Summer tugged at her sleeve, giggling.**

Celestia crouched down, pressing a soft kiss to her baby sister’s forehead.

"I’ll be back before you know it, baby Summer," she whispered.

**She truly believed that.**

None of them knew the truth.

**This was the last time Celestia and Summer would see each other.**

Destiny had other plans.

And just like that, she stepped into the carriage.

As the wheels began to turn, carrying her toward the capital—toward the unknown—Celestia looked back one last time.

Lucian, Lillian, Summer.

**Her family.**

Slowly, they faded into the distance.
